<p class="drop-cap">ON the top floor of Grafton&#8217;s
house, in Michigan Avenue,
there was a room filled with
what he called &#8220;the sins of the
fathers&#8221;&mdash;the bad pictures and statuary
come down from two generations of more
or less misdirected enthusiasm for art.
In old age his father had begun this collection;
forty years of dogged pursuit of
good taste taught him much. Grafton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
completed it as soon as he came into
possession.</p>

<p>In him a Grafton at last combined
right instinct and right judgment. Although
he was not yet thirty, every picture
dealer of note in America and Europe
knew him, and he knew not only them
but also a multitude of small dealers with
whom he carefully kept himself unknown.
He was no mere picture buyer.
The pretentious plutocrats of that class
excited in him contempt&mdash;and resentment.
How often had one of them destroyed,
with a coarse fling of a moneybag,
his subtle plans to capture a remarkable
old picture at a small price. For
he was a true collector&mdash;he knew pictures,
he knew where they were to be found,
he knew how to lie in wait patiently, how
to search secretly. And no small part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of his pride in his acquisitions came from
what they represented as exhibits of his
skill as a collector.</p>

<p>A few months before his father died
they were in New York and went together
to see the collection of that famous
plutocratic wholesale picture buyer, Henry
Acton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see the young Spaniard over
there?&#8221; said the father, pointing to one
of the best-placed pictures in the room.</p>

<p>The son looked at it and was at once
struck by the boldness, the imagination
with which it was painted. &#8220;Acton has
it credited to Velasquez,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
does look something like Velasquez, but
it isn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That picture was one of my costly
mistakes,&#8221; continued the elder Grafton.
&#8220;I bought it as a Velasquez. I was completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
taken in&mdash;paid eleven thousand
dollars for it in Paris about twenty-five
years ago. But I soon found out what
I&#8217;d done. How the critics did laugh at
me! When the noise quieted down I
sold it. It was shipped back to Paris
and they palmed it off on Acton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Acton joined them. &#8220;We
were talking of your Velasquez there,&#8221;
said the elder Grafton.</p>

<p>Acton grew red&mdash;the mention of that
picture always put him angrily on the
defensive. &#8220;Yes; it <i>is</i> a Velasquez.
These ignorant critics say it isn&#8217;t, but I
know a Velasquez when I see one. And
I know Velasquez painted that face, or
it wasn&#8217;t painted. It&#8217;ll hang there as
a Velasquez while I live, and when I die
it&#8217;ll hang in the Metropolitan Museum
as a Velasquez. If they try to catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
it any other way they lose my whole collection.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Acton was talking the younger
Grafton was absorbed in the picture. The
longer he looked the more he admired.
He cared for pictures as well as for names,
and he saw that this portrait was from
a master-hand&mdash;the unknown painter had
expressed through the features of that
one face the whole of the Spaniard in the
Middle Ages. He felt it was a reflection
upon the name of Grafton that such a
work of genius had been cast out obviously
because a Grafton could appreciate
only names. He said nothing to
his father, but then and there made up
his mind that he would have that picture
back.</p>

<p>Apparently there was no hope. But
he was not discouraged; patience and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
tenacity were the main factors in his temperament.</p>

<p>While he was sick with typhoid fever at
a New York hotel Acton got into financial
difficulties and was forced to &#8220;realize&#8221; on
all his personal property. His pictures
were hurriedly sent to the auctioneer.
Grafton, a few days past the crisis in his
illness, heard the news at nine o&#8217;clock in
the evening of the third and last day of
the sale. He leaped from bed and ordered
the nurse to help him dress. He brushed
aside protests and pleadings and warnings.
They went together to Mendelssohn Hall.
Grafton made the driver gallop the horses.
He rushed in; his Spaniard was on the
easel.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much is bid?&#8221; he called out.</p>

<p>Everybody looked round, and the auctioneer
replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s just been sold.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>There was a laugh, Grafton looked so
wild and strange. Leaning on the arm of
the nurse he went to the settlement desk.
&#8220;To whom was that picture sold?&#8221; he said
to the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;On a cable from Paris, Mr. Grafton,&#8221;
interrupted one of the members of the auction
firm. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a standing order
from Candace Brothers for five years to
let them know if the picture came or was
likely to come into the market. And
they&#8217;ve cabled every six months to remind
us. When Mr. Acton decided to sell, we
sent word. They ordered us to buy, with
fifteen thousand dollars as the limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton was furious; he would gladly
have paid twenty. &#8220;And what did it go
for?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventeen hundred,&#8221; replied the dealer.
&#8220;Everybody was suspicious of it. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
would have got it for five hundred, if it
hadn&#8217;t been for an artist; he bid it up to
his limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must sit,&#8221; said Grafton to his nurse.
&#8220;This is too much&mdash;too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was little the worse for his imprudence,
and was able to sail on the steamer
that carried the picture. He beat it to
Paris, and went at once to Candace Brothers,
strolling in as if he had no purpose
beyond killing time by looking about.
He slowly led the conversation round to a
point where Louis Candace, to whom he
was talking, would naturally begin to
think of the Acton sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting in several pictures from
New York,&#8221; said Candace&mdash;&#8220;from the
Acton sale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was ill while it was on,&#8221; said Grafton,
carelessly. &#8220;What did you take?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>&#8220;A Rousseau, a Corot, a Wyant, and a&mdash;Velasquez.&#8221;
He hesitated before speaking
the last name, and looked confused as
Grafton slightly elevated his eyebrows.
&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he hurried on, &#8220;we strongly
suspect the Velasquez; in fact, we know
it&#8217;s not genuine. But we&#8217;re delighted to
get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said Grafton.
&#8220;I know you too well to suspect that it
will be sold as a Velasquez.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But certainly not. Even if we did
that sort of thing, we couldn&#8217;t deceive any
of your rich countrymen or any of the
English with it. The story is too well
known. No; we bought it for His Royal
Highness the Grand Duke of Zweitenbourg.
It is&mdash;or he thinks it is&mdash;a portrait
of one of his Spanish ancestors. His
agent tells me that it is the only known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
work of a remarkable young Spaniard who
was soon afterwards killed at the siege
of Barcelona, early in the eighteenth century.
They are not even sure of his name.
The Grand Duke was most anxious to get
it. For years we have been sending him
semiannual bulletins on Monsieur Acton&#8217;s
health and financial condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton&#8217;s heart sank. Here was a true
collector&mdash;a past-master of the art. &#8220;If I
hadn&#8217;t been a mere novice,&#8221; thought Grafton,
&#8220;I, too, would have had bulletins on
Acton, and a standing order. As it is, my
trouble has only begun,&#8221; for, being himself
a true collector, with all the fatalism
of the collector&#8217;s temperament, he was not
despairing, was only the more resolute in
face of these new difficulties.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Royal Highness,&#8221; continued Candace,
&#8220;wants the picture because it fills<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
one of the gaps in his gallery of ancestral
portraits.&#8221; Under skilful questioning,
Candace yielded the further information
that the keeper of the Grand Duke&#8217;s privy
purse, Baron Zeppstein, would arrive the
following Thursday personally to escort
the picture to Zweitenbourg.</p>

<p>It reached Paris on Tuesday, and Grafton
took Jack Campbell, whom he found at
the Ritz, round to Candace&#8217;s on Wednesday
morning. Campbell, having been thoroughly
coached, made offers for several
pictures, all too low, then pretended to
fall in love with the Spaniard. He insisted
that it was a Velasquez&mdash;Grafton
seemed to be disgusted with him, somewhat
ashamed of him. When Candace
told him that the picture was sold, he had
them send a telegram to the Grand Duke
offering eight thousand dollars for it. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
curt refusal to sell at any price came a few
hours later.</p>

<p>Campbell and Grafton were there the
next morning when Baron Zeppstein came.
As he was voluble, and appreciative of
the rare pleasure of an attentive listener,
Grafton rapidly ingratiated himself, and
soon had him flowing on the subject of
&#8220;my royal master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His Royal Highness has two passions,&#8221;
said the Baron, &#8220;Americans and his pictures.
You Americans are making astonishing&mdash;I
may say appalling&mdash;inroads in
Germany; your ideas are getting even into
the heads of our women, our girls. I don&#8217;t
like it; I don&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s breeding a
race of thinking women. I can&#8217;t endure
a thinking woman. You can&#8217;t imagine
what I&#8217;m suffering just now through Her
Serene Highness; but no matter. Your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
terrible democratic ideas of disrespect for
tradition, for institutions, for restraints,
are slipping about even in the palaces of
our kings. His Royal Highness&mdash;the story
goes that he was in love with one of your
beautiful countrywomen and that she refused
to marry him; she did marry his
brother, Duke Wolfgang&mdash;morganatically,
of course. It would be impossible for one
of the house of Traubenheim to marry
a commoner in the regular way. Your
American invasion hasn&#8217;t extended that
far&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the pictures?&#8221; interrupted Grafton,
impatient of the digression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;yes&mdash;<i>there</i> His Royal Highness
has a high enthusiasm, a noble passion.
He is positively mad about Rembrandts.
He has a notable collection of them, and
is always trying to add to it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>Grafton&#8217;s eyes dropped; he feared that
this simple old Zweitenbourgian might
read his thoughts. &#8220;Rembrandts?&#8221; he
said. &#8220;That interests me. I have the
same craze in a small way.&#8221; And he
drew the Baron on. He learned that a
Rembrandt filled the Grand Duke with
the same burning longing for possession
with which his craze, the spurious Velasquez,
was now filling him. He began
to see victory. He cabled his Chicago
agent to send him forthwith, in care of
Candace Brothers, his two examples of
Rembrandt&#8217;s early work. When he was
a boy, travelling about with his father,
he had found them in an obscure shop in
Leyden. They now interested him little
except as reminders of an early triumph.
But to a collector of Rembrandts they
would be treasures.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>A few days after sending the cable he
went in the morning with Mrs. Campbell
to Paquin&#8217;s&mdash;Mrs. Campbell was at
Paris for her annual shopping. She was
to be fitted for six dresses, she explained,
and that meant an hour&mdash;perhaps two
or three hours. But Grafton was so attracted
by the scene that he said he would
wait, at least until he was tired. He
seated himself on the sofa against the
wall, near the door. It was in line with
the passage-way into which the fitting-salons
open.</p>

<p>The general room was crowded with
women&mdash;women in the fashions of the day
preparing for the fashions of the morrow;
girls&mdash;the pretty, graceful, polite dressmakers&#8217;
assistants famed in Parisian song
and story&mdash;persuading, soothing, cajoling,
flattering. There were a few men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
all of them fitters except two. The exceptions
were Grafton, trying to efface
himself, and Paquin, trying to escape.
He had come forth at the request of a
customer important enough to be worthy
of personal attention, but not important
enough to be admitted to the honor of his
private consultation-room. The women
had seized him and, regardless of his bored
and absent expression and speech, were
swarming about him, impeding his retreat.</p>

<p>Grafton soon forgot himself, so interested
was he in his surroundings&mdash;the clamor
in French, German, English, American,
Italian, Spanish; the exhibits of manners
grand and manners sordid; the play of
feminine emotions&mdash;the passion for dress,
the thoughtful pauses before plunging
into tempting extravagances, the reckless
yieldings to temptation, the woe-begone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
putting aside of temptation; the mingling
of women of all degrees, from royalty and
American to actress and demi-mondaine.
And they so far ignored the male intruder
that they were presently tossing aside
dresses into his lap or spreading them
against his knees for better display. He
retreated along the sofa before up-piling
silks and satins and laces and linens. At
last he had to choose between being submerged
and abandoning the sofa. He
still lingered, meekly standing, his hat
and stick buried. As he was examining
an evening dress that pleased him mightily&mdash;a
new kind of silk in new shades, a cream
white over which a haze of the palest blue-green
seemed to be drifting&mdash;he chanced
to glance along the passage-way.</p>

<p>One of the fitting-salons was open, and
half in the doorway, half in the hall, stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
a young woman. Her waist was off;
her handsome shoulders and arms were
bare, yet no more than if she had been in
evening dress. She had fine brown hair
with much red in it. Her features were
strong and rather haughty, but delicate
and pleasing. Her skin was dead-white,
colorless even on her cheeks. She was
frowning and biting her lip and tapping
her foot on the floor. As he glanced she
caught his eye. She beckoned imperiously.</p>

<p>He put down the dress and went slowly
towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick,&#8221; she said, in French. &#8220;My
patience is exhausted. I&#8217;ve been waiting
half an hour and no fitter has come. Are
you a fitter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied, also in French. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not exactly a fitter; I&#8217;m a&mdash;an American.
But I&#8217;ll get you one.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; exclaimed the young woman,
in English, and she darted into her
salon and slammed the door.</p>

<p>Two attendants&mdash;a man and a woman&mdash;came
at him from opposite directions.
&#8220;But, monsieur! But, monsieur! What
does monsieur do here? It is forbidden!&#8221;
Their politeness was thin, indeed, over their
alarm and indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lady called me,&#8221; explained Grafton,
calmly. &#8220;It was impossible for me to
disobey her. She thought I was a fitter.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke she opened her door and
showed her head. The attendants, with
serious faces, began to pour out apologies.
&#8220;Pardon, Your Serene Highness! We
hope that your&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my fault,&#8221; she interrupted, in
French, and he noted that she had a German
accent. Her look of condescending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
good-nature was not flattering to him.
It said that in the mind of Her Serene
Highness he and the two attendants
formed a trio of inferior persons before
whom she could conduct herself with
almost as much freedom as before so many
blocks of wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;No apology is necessary,&#8221; he said,
with abrupt courtesy. &#8220;You wish a fitter.
I&#8217;ll see that you get one at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her Serene Highness flushed and withdrew
her head. &#8220;Take him away,&#8221; she
called through the door, in a haughty tone,
&#8220;and send a fitter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton faced the attendants. He drew
from his pocket two ten-franc pieces and
gave one to each. &#8220;Have the goodness
to get mademoiselle her fitter instantly,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>They bowed and thanked him and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
slowly returned to his sofa. Half an
hour and she issued from her salon in
street costume. Close behind her came
an old-maidish German woman. As they
reached the door, Grafton held it open.
Her Serene Highness drew herself up
coldly. He bowed with politeness and
without impertinence, and closed the door
behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was that lady?&#8221; he said to her
fitter, hurrying past with her dresses on
his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her Serene Highness the Duchess
Erica of Zweitenbourg, monsieur. She is
the niece of His Royal Highness the Grand
Duke Casimir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton met her twice the next day.
In the morning he was at the tomb of
Napoleon. A woman&mdash;one of two walking
together a short distance in front of him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>&mdash;dropped
her handkerchief. He picked
it up and overtook her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, mademoiselle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your
handkerchief.&#8221; She paused. He saw that
it was Her Serene Highness. At the same
time she recognized him and the smile
she had begun died away. She took the
handkerchief with an icy &#8220;Thanks.&#8221; He
dropped back, but their way happened to
be his. Her companion glanced round presently;
he was near enough to hear her say,
&#8220;The person is following Your Serene
Highness.&#8221; He came on, passed them as
if unconscious of their existence, and they
changed their route.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he was at the Louvre.
He saw two women coming towards him&mdash;Her
Serene Highness and her companion.
As they saw him they turned
abruptly into a side corridor. He came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
to where they had turned; there lay a
handkerchief. He picked it up and noted
that it was a fine one, deeply bordered
with real lace. In the corner, under a
ducal crown, was the initial &#8220;E.&#8221; He
walked rapidly after the two women and,
although they quickened their pace, he
was soon beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, mademoiselle,&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>Her Serene Highness flushed with anger
and her gray eyes blazed. &#8220;This is
insufferable!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;If you do
not leave&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your handkerchief,&#8221; he said, extending
it, his eyes smiling but his face grave.</p>

<p>She looked at it in horror. &#8220;Monsieur
is mistaken,&#8221; she said, fighting against
embarrassment and a feeling that she
had made herself ridiculous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle is mistaken&mdash;doubly mistaken,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
he replied, tranquilly. &#8220;The handkerchief
bears her monogram, and&#8221;&mdash;here
he smiled satirically&mdash;&#8220;if mademoiselle
is vain enough to mistake common courtesy
for impudence, I am not vain enough
to mistake accident&mdash;even <i>twice repeated</i>
accident&mdash;for design.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him with generous, impulsive
repentance and took the handkerchief
from his outstretched hand. &#8220;It
is mine,&#8221; she said, in English, &#8220;and I regret
my foolish mistake.&#8221; Her tone had
no suggestion of condescension. It was
the tone of the universal woman in presence
of the universal man.</p>

<p>He bowed his appreciation without speaking
and went rapidly away.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN his Rembrandts came,
Grafton took the package to
his hotel, opened it, assured
himself that they were in good
condition, sealed it, and left it with Candace
Brothers. &#8220;I may telegraph you to
forward it,&#8221; he said. But he did not tell
them what was in it nor where he was
going; they might betray him or forestall
him, and so deprive him of the pleasure
of a successful campaign in person
and unaided.</p>

<p>He reached the town of Zweitenbourg
at noon on a Monday, five days after his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Spaniard. At half-past two he was in a
walking suit and on his way to the Grand
Ducal Palace, &#8220;The Castle,&#8221; to reconnoitre.
It was July, and the air of that elevated
valley was both warm and bracing. From
the beautiful road hills and mountains
could be seen on every side&mdash;the frontiers
of the Grand Duchy.</p>

<p>It had once been almost a kingdom.
It was now shrunk, through the bad political
and matrimonial management of the
reigning house, to less than two hundred
and fifty square miles. But the Zweitenbourgians
were proudly patriotic&mdash;they
disdained mere size; they were all for
quality, not quantity. Besides, they were
as vague in general geography as the
average human being; they thoroughly
knew only the internal geography of Zweitenbourg.
In their text-books the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Duchy posed as the central state of civilization.
In their school histories its grand
dukes cut a great figure. For example,
it was their Grand Duke Godfrey who,
slightly assisted by a Prussian general,
Bl&uuml;cher, won the battle of Waterloo. Wellington
comes in for a mere mention, as a
sort of &#8220;among those present&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;a small
force of English under a Lord Wellington,&#8221;
so runs the account, &#8220;was defeated
in the first day&#8217;s engagement and almost
caused the rout of the Grand Duke Godfrey
and his allies; but on the second day,
after the English had been beaten, and
when they were about to run, the Grand
Duke and Bl&uuml;cher came up with the main
army and Napoleon was overthrown.&#8221; In
the Zweitenbourg atlases the map of each
country was printed on a separate plate,
and all were apparently of about the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
size. And, finally, all Zweitenbourgians
knew that their men were the bravest and
their women the most beautiful in the world,
and that all foreign nations were inhabited
by peoples who were ignorant, foolish,
and perfidious.</p>

<p>After two miles between garden-like
farms, Grafton found himself at the entrance
to what seemed a wilderness. There were
two huge stone pillars, each capped with
a grand-ducal crown. There were two
great bronze gates with a large C under a
crown in the centre of each. The gates
were open, and between the pillars went
the military road, clean, smooth, perfect,
to plunge into the wilderness. Beside the
entrance was an ivy-covered lodge, in front
of it a soldier in the blue and white uniform
of the Grand Duke&#8217;s Household
Guards. He was marching up and down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
his rifle at shoulder arms. As Grafton
advanced he halted and shifted his rifle to
a challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show your passport,&#8221; he commanded,
in a queer dialect of German.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no passport,&#8221; replied Grafton.</p>

<p>The soldier looked at him stupidly.
&#8220;But every foreigner has a passport,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah; very well.&#8221; The soldier shrugged
his shoulders and resumed his march.</p>

<p>Grafton stood where he had halted.
&#8220;May I go on?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; why not?&#8221; said the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did you ask for my passport?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in the rules. Pass on or you may
get into trouble. You know perfectly well
that all are admitted to the park at this
season.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>&#8220;Then there is a closed season?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the soldier, crossly.
&#8220;I never heard of one. It&#8217;s in the rules to
admit every one from April until December.
No one comes the rest of the year. But I
don&#8217;t suppose he could be shut out if he
did. There&#8217;s no rule which says so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why these rules?&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier gave the profoundly thoughtful
frown of those incapable of thought.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Soldiers must
have rules. Everything must be done by
rules, so that it will be done just as it
used to be. We&#8217;ve had the same rules&mdash;oh,
hundreds of years. Nothing must be
changed. What&#8217;s new is bad, what&#8217;s old
is good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton trudged on into the wilderness.
The road gradually swept into another
road. He saw that it was a circle, a girdle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
about a lake which was perhaps four miles
long and two miles wide, blue as the sky
and mirroring it to its smallest flake of
snowy cloud. Opposite him, across the
width of the lake, towered and spread
The Castle, with turrets and battlements,
a vast, irregular mantle of ivy draping
part of its old gray front. He could see
terraces and lawns of brilliant green, the
gaudiness of flower-beds and flowering
bushes, red and blue and purple and yellow.
&#8220;Where Her Serene Highness lives,&#8221;
he thought.</p>

<p>He decided to walk as far as The Castle;
next day he would drive and perhaps pay
his respects to Baron Zeppstein. He was
impressed by the loneliness of the park,
apparently an untouched wilderness except
the road. The birds were singing.
Now and then there would be a crash and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
he would see a deer making off, or a whir
and a scurrying flapping, and he would
get a glimpse of some wild bird in panic-stricken
flight. As he came nearer to The
Castle the signs of habitation were numerous,
but still not a human being. At
last he was close to the walls, looking up
at them.</p>

<p>He could see nothing but the perfect
order of the shrubbery to indicate that
any one had been there recently. The
huge gates&mdash;solid doors rather than gates&mdash;were
closed. The sun was shining,
the waters of the lake glistened, the foliage
was fresh and vivid, the soft, strong
air blew in a gentle breeze. But there
was a profound hush, as if the grim old
fortress-palace, and all within and around
it, had long been locked in a magic sleep.</p>

<p>A sense of uncanniness was creeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
over him in spite of his incredulous American
mind. He was startled by a trumpet
blast which seemed to come from the depth
of the woods to the left. Standing in the
middle of the road, he turned. He had
just time to jump aside.</p>

<p>Out of the woods, by a cross-road he had
not noted, swept a gorgeous cavalcade.
As he looked he felt more strongly than
ever like a time-wanderer who had been,
in a twinkling, borne backward several
centuries. First to pass him at a mad
gallop were six soldiers on tall black chargers.
They and their horses were trapped
in the blue and white of the Household
Guards. Corselets and plumed helmets
and chains clashed and rattled and flashed
as they flew past. A few yards behind
them, at the same furious pace, came a
graceful, long-bodied carriage of strange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
coloring and design, drawn by eight black
horses with postilions. On a curious foot-board
at the back of the carriage stood two
footmen in a medi&aelig;val livery. They were
hanging on by straps. Behind the carriage
came six more black-horsed cavalrymen
of the Household Guards.</p>

<p>As Grafton gaped through the dust
in the wake of this ancient spectacle it
halted before The Castle&#8217;s gates so abruptly
that every horse reared to its
haunches. But immediately all was quiet,
motionless. One of the cavalrymen put
a trumpet to his lips and sent a blast echoing
and re-echoing like a peal of fairy
laughter to and fro over the lake. As
if there were enchantment in that blast,
the great weather and battle scarred doors
of The Castle swung noiselessly back.
Out came eight men in medi&aelig;val costumes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
each bearing a long, slender, brazen trumpet.
Four went to either side of the entrance.
They put the trumpets to their
lips and sounded a fanfare.</p>

<p>Grafton&#8217;s expectation was at excitement
pitch. What did this gorgeous revival
of medi&aelig;valism presage? what dazzling
apparition was about to greet his
ravished eyes?</p>

<p>Now appeared a man in medi&aelig;val court
costume, resplendent in velvet and lace
and silver braid. He was walking backward,
bowing low at each step, his velvet,
beplumed hat in his hand. And then
the central figure&mdash;His Royal Highness
Casimir of Traubenheim, Grand Duke
of Zweitenbourg, Prince of the Holy Roman
Empire, Margrave of Plaut, Prince
of Wiesser, of Dinn, of Feltenheim, Count
in Brausch and in Ranau. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
sallow, cross-looking little man, with thin
shoulders, legs, and arms, and a great
paunch of a stomach, dilated and sagged
from overfeeding. He was dressed in a
baggy tweed suit and a straight-brimmed
top-hat. He seated himself in the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an anticlimax!&#8221; thought Grafton.
But there was a second and briefer
flourish of the trumpets, and then appeared
the Duchess Erica, in a white cloth dress
and a big white hat and carrying a white
parasol. Grafton felt like applauding.
&#8220;The spectacle is looking up,&#8221; he said.
He was near enough to note that her sweet
face was discontented, impatient, almost
sad. She seated herself beside the Grand
Duke. The mounted trumpeter blew, the
cavalrymen in front wheeled and struck
spurs into their horses, the whole procession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
was instant whirling away&mdash;it was
gone. Grafton glanced at The Castle doors;
they were closed again and the trumpeters
and the courtier had disappeared.
The dust settled, the magic sleep descended.</p>

<p>Grafton might have thought himself
the victim of an illusion had he not seen,
far away across the lake, a cloud of dust,
and in front of it the gaudy cavalcade
and the grand-ducal carriage, the shine
of blue and silver and polished steel rushing
along as if fleeing from a fiend.
And after a few minutes it came towards
The Castle again from the other direction.
The horses were dripping, their coats
streaked with foam. At the entrance
there were the same startling halt, the same
mysterious opening of doors, the same
stage-like assembling of trumpeters, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
same flourishes. The Grand Duke and
his niece and the attendants disappeared,
the procession fled into the woods; there
was silence and ancient repose once more.</p>

<p>Grafton set out on the return walk,
trying to force himself to stop thinking
of Her Serene Highness and to resume
thinking of her uncle and his Spaniard.
He had not gone far when a court-officer
issued from a by-path. He paused to get
a good look at this romantic figure, and
presently recognized beneath the enfoldings
of finery his commonplace, voluble
acquaintance of the Paris picture-shop,
Baron Zeppstein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how d&#8217;ye do, Baron Zeppstein!&#8221;
he called out.</p>

<p>The Baron looked at him superciliously,
then collapsed into cordiality. &#8220;Meester
Grafton!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It is a pleasure&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
joyful surprise. I did not know
you at first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I you,&#8221; said Grafton. &#8220;I seem to
be the only modern thing here&mdash;except the
old gentleman who took that quiet jog
around the lake a few minutes ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His Royal Highness,&#8221; corrected the
Baron, pompously. &#8220;He takes a drive
every afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good show,&#8221; said Grafton. &#8220;But
I think I&#8217;d tire of it. I&#8217;d rather look at
it than be in it. I should say that he
earned his salary.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baron laughed vaguely. &#8220;You
Americans do not understand our ways,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You are so practical&mdash;so busy.
You have no time for tradition and beauty
and ceremony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we&#8217;re a common lot,&#8221; said Grafton.
&#8220;We&#8217;d think this sort of thing was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
a joke if it happened outside of a circus.
But it&#8217;s a very serious business, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
His face was grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is; it is, indeed,&#8221; said Zeppstein,
his shallow old face taking on a look of
melancholy importance. &#8220;But we must
do our public duty; we must accept the
cares of high station. And His Royal
Highness&mdash;ah, how he suffers! We others
have our relaxations&mdash;we get away to
our families. But His Royal Highness&mdash;this
is his vacation. And, mein Gott,
he yawns and curses all day long. Yes,
it is trying to be near the great of earth,
but not so trying as to be great.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks ill-tempered,&#8221; said Grafton,
sympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;But think what he suffers. Imagine!
Usually he must wear a heavy, tight uniform
and a steel helmet; he says it has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
given him the headache almost every day
for twenty-seven years. But the dignity
of the nation must be maintained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Grafton. &#8220;And
when is the best time to see him? I&#8217;m
going to call on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeppstein looked at the American as if
he thought him insane. &#8220;But, my dear
sir,&#8221; he said, deprecatingly, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
understand. You will have to wait until
His Royal Highness&#8217;s vacation is over.
Then you must go to your minister and
he will lay your wish before the Grand
Chamberlain. And if possible your name
will be placed on the list for one of the
levees&mdash;there are five each winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to see the Grand Duke
in his official capacity; it&#8217;s a little private
matter&mdash;about a picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Grand Duke has no other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
capacity. He is head of the state; he is
the state every hour of every day, except
when he&#8217;s abroad. Then he often graciously
condescends to be a mere gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t wait. You ought to be
able to arrange it. You&#8217;ve got influence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Baron Zeppstein was flattered.
&#8220;But, unfortunately, none is permitted to
speak to His Royal Highness unless he
has commanded it&mdash;that is, no one but
his son, the Inheriting Grand Duke, and
his niece, the Duchess Erica, and the Grand
Chamberlain. And&mdash;I am, just at present,
at outs with them. Her Serene Highness
is most intractable&mdash;one of the new
school of wild young princesses who are
cutting loose from everything in these
degenerate days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She certainly doesn&#8217;t look tame.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>&#8220;I had the honor of escorting her to
Paris when I went for His Royal Highness&#8217;s
picture,&#8221; Zeppstein continued. &#8220;It
was a painful experience. And instead of
sustaining me, His Royal Highness&mdash;but
it was most humiliating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; said Grafton. &#8220;I can be
of service to you. I own a Rembrandt
which I wish to let the Grand Duke have
at a bargain. I&#8217;m certain he&#8217;ll be most
anxious to get it once he hears of it. Now,
if you should be of assistance to him in
getting it, he would be grateful, wouldn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeppstein became thoughtful. &#8220;Not
grateful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t in His Royal
Highness to be grateful. But it might
make him think me useful. What do you
propose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I can&#8217;t tell yet. Keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
quiet until I&#8217;ve looked over the ground
and made my plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at your service,&#8221; said Zeppstein.
&#8220;You would weep to hear how the Grand
Chamberlain and his faction have humiliated
me. They make me the butt of
their jokes at dinner to amuse His Royal
Highness. They&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall be revenged,&#8221; said Grafton,
shaking hands with him and hurrying away.</p>

<p>From the moment he recognized old
Zeppstein until he left him he had been
fighting to restrain himself from leading
the talk to Erica. He now caught himself
regretting it. He stopped short. &#8220;Ridiculous!&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;What an idiot I
am to let such ideas into my head. It must
be in the air here. I&#8217;m getting as romantic
as&mdash;as&mdash;as she looks.&#8221; And he walked
on, her face and her voice haunting him.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">GRAFTON learned that the next
was one of the three weekly
public days at the Grand
Duke&#8217;s galleries. About eleven
the next morning he went to look at his
Spaniard and develop his plans for its
capture. As he neared The Castle he saw
a gardener at work upon his knees, trimming
a bush of big pink and white flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the entrance to the galleries?&#8221;
he asked, when he was within a yard of
the gardener.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; whispered the gardener, looking
nervously up at the windows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Grafton, following
his glance and seeing nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Royal Highness permits no noise,&#8221;
replied the gardener in an undertone.
&#8220;He hears every sound&mdash;especially every
little sound. Only Sunday it was that he
sent out to have the noise stopped. And
there was no noise that anybody could
hear. And when the First Gentleman of
the Bedchamber reported it to His Royal
Highness, what do you think His Royal
Highness said? It was marvellous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he say?&#8221; inquired Grafton.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Royal Highness said, &#8216;It is the
sound of the grass and bushes growing.
Tear them up!&#8217; Isn&#8217;t it wonderful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; said Grafton. &#8220;Why
aren&#8217;t they torn up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the gentlemen of the court entreated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
and at last dissuaded His Royal Highness.
It was a terrible crisis. Some of the gentlemen
were weak from agitation and
sweating. Yes, His Royal Highness is
a true prince. Only a true prince could
hear grass and bushes grow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fortunate he&#8217;s a prince, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
said Grafton. &#8220;Now, if he were an ordinary
mortal they&#8217;d lock him up in a lunatic
asylum.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gardener gave a frightened look at
the windows, then almost whispered: &#8220;Yes,
that is so. But princes are different from
us; they&#8217;re so sensitive, so high-bred. I
often think of the things they do here,
and I say, &#8216;If I were to do that, they&#8217;d
think I was light in the head.&#8217; But, of
course, princes can&#8217;t be judged like ordinary
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; assented Grafton, &#8220;that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
would never do. Where is the entrance to
the galleries?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the path to the left until you
come to the modern wing. The entrance
is under the balcony; you will see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton followed the gardener&#8217;s directions
and, climbing the steps, was about
to open the door. At each side, in the
same frame, were long, narrow glass windows.
At one of these peeping-windows
he saw the Grand Duke, his mouth distended
in a tremendous yawn. Grafton
hesitated. The Grand Duke, in an old,
black frock-suit, opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said Grafton. &#8220;Are
you the keeper of the galleries. These are
the Grand Duke&#8217;s galleries, are they not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Grand Duke beamed.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an American,&#8221; continued Grafton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
&#8220;and I&#8217;m much interested in pictures.
I particularly wished to see the Grand
Duke&#8217;s Rembrandts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah; it will be a pleasure to show you
through. We like Americans here.&#8221; He
spoke in excellent English. &#8220;We once
had an American at our little court. But
when her husband died she fled. It was
too dull for her. But we have to stay
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surprise me,&#8221; said Grafton. &#8220;I
had always heard that the Grand Duke
was a most interesting, a most unusual
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Casimir shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;He
is the most bored of all. He does nothing
but regret his youth. He is old, worn-out,
a poor creature&mdash;no strength, no
stomach, no nothing but memories, and
a bad temper. And he doesn&#8217;t get much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
pleasure out of his temper. Of what use
is a temper when no one dares answer
back?&#8221;</p>

<p>They had come to Grafton&#8217;s Spaniard,
indifferently hung among the fierce-looking
Teutonic war-lords in armor. &#8220;Evidently
he doesn&#8217;t care especially for it,&#8221;
said Grafton to himself. Aloud he said:
&#8220;What a collection of fighters!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder they fought,&#8221; replied the
Grand Duke. &#8220;They were so bored that
they had to fight to save themselves from
suicide or lunacy. Any one would make
war in their position&mdash;if he dared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t allowed so much nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; worse luck,&#8221; growled the Grand
Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Grafton. &#8220;There&#8217;s
the spurious Velasquez from Acton&#8217;s collection.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Surely the Grand Duke wasn&#8217;t
caught on that.&#8221; Grafton went to the
proper distance and angle and examined
his beloved Spaniard with a tranquil
face and a covetous heart. &#8220;It seems
strange to meet an old acquaintance so
far from home. If I hadn&#8217;t been ill when
Acton sold, I&#8217;d have bid on this. It&#8217;s
pleasing, very pleasing, though clearly
not a Velasquez.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We got it because it is a portrait of
one of our house&mdash;the Duke of Hispania
Media, who captured Barcelona early in
the eighteenth century.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that before or after the Archduke
Charles took it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the capture sometimes erroneously
credited to the Archduke Charles.
He was present, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton laughed good-naturedly. &#8220;And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
in England I suppose they&#8217;d say Peterborough
took it&mdash;he was present, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The English are great liars,&#8221; said
Casimir, sourly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what every nation says about
every other,&#8221; said Grafton.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke chuckled. &#8220;And all
are right. Now we come to the Rembrandts.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a fine collection, and Grafton
and the Grand Duke went slowly from
picture to picture, from drawing to drawing,
comparing opinions, telling stories
of experiences in collecting. When they
reached the examples of Rembrandt&#8217;s early
work, Grafton was enthusiastic. &#8220;But,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;it is too small; there should
be more examples.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; Casimir sighed. &#8220;It is not so
satisfactory as we wish.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>&#8220;Possibly I attach more importance
to this weak spot,&#8221; continued Grafton,
&#8220;than another would, because I have an
example of his early work and so am interested
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your example, may I ask?&#8221;
Casimir spoke in a too casual tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;A peasant woman with an astonishingly
handsome-ugly face; it&#8217;s usually
described as &#8216;The Woman with the Earrings,&#8217;
because they are very queerly
shaped.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Grafton thus described the smaller
and less interesting of his two early Rembrandts,
he watched Casimir&#8217;s face mirrored
in the glass over a picture. He
saw a swift glance, so piercing that
he would not have believed those burned-out
eyes capable of it. But when Casimir
spoke it was to say, carelessly, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
think I&#8217;ve heard of it&mdash;a small affair,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get more than fifteen or
twenty thousand marks for it, if I were
selling it,&#8221; said Grafton. If he had not
seen the swoop of that covetous collector
glance he would have been discouraged
and would have begun to talk of his larger
Rembrandt. But he decided to wait.
Perhaps the smaller Rembrandt would
alone get him his Spaniard, and possibly
another picture to boot.</p>

<p>They went on with their examination.
Apparently the Grafton Rembrandt had
passed from the Grand Duke&#8217;s mind.
After three-quarters of an hour he said:
&#8220;Now this, I think, antedates your
&#8216;Armorer.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The only outward sign of confusion
Grafton gave was to pause abruptly in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
his walk. &#8220;Your &#8216;Armorer&#8217;!&#8221;&mdash;that was
his other and finer Rembrandt. How
did the Grand Duke know he had it when
he had not spoken of it? &#8220;Fool that
I am!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;The Grand
Duke knows his subject, knows where
the Rembrandts are. Why, he now knows
my name, I&#8217;ll wager.&#8221; He was much
depressed; he felt that he would not get
his Spaniard either easily or cheaply.
&#8220;The only advantage I have left is that
he doesn&#8217;t know just what I want, though,
no doubt, he has made up his mind that
I&#8217;m not here for mere sight-seeing.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he was thinking he was examining
the picture to which Casimir had called
attention. He now said: &#8220;No, I think
not; I&#8217;m sure my &#8216;Woman with the Earrings&#8217;
antedates it.&#8221; Again the glass
covering of a picture betrayed Casimir;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Grafton saw a look of relief in his face.
&#8220;He knew he&#8217;d made a break,&#8221; thought
Grafton, &#8220;and now he hopes I didn&#8217;t notice
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few minutes Grafton said he
must be going. Casimir&#8217;s face was as
unreadable as his own; no one could
have suspected from looking at either
that both were determined to meet again.
Grafton thanked Casimir heartily and
turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you stay long here?&#8221; asked Casimir.</p>

<p>&#8220;A day or two, perhaps,&#8221; replied Grafton.
&#8220;My plans are unsettled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow is a closed day. But if
you return, I shall be glad to show you
the rest of the collection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton knew he had scored. &#8220;You are
very kind,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is possible that I may be able to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
show you through His Royal Highness&#8217;s
apartments. There are several remarkable
pictures&mdash;a Leonardo, a few Van Dycks,
and some interesting moderns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be delightful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is agreed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can arrange it. At what hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At ten. I shall expect you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can come. You are most
courteous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pleasure. Until to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CLEAR of The Castle, Grafton
looked at his watch; it was
half-past three. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
the servant poked his head in
at the door so often,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;We
were at it more than three hours.&#8221; He
strode along in a jubilant frame of mind.
He felt that the Spaniard was practically
his; it was a question of detail. And
Casimir was a worthy antagonist; the
struggle would be full of interest for
both.</p>

<p>He was still a quarter of a mile from
the park gates when he heard a scream.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
He listened; nearly half a minute of
silence, and then a lusty-lunged feminine
call for help. He dashed into the wilderness,
breaking a path with difficulty
through the heavy undergrowth. He had
gone three or four hundred yards, guided
by the repeated calls, when he heard in
the same voice, in German: &#8220;Come no
nearer until I explain.&#8221; He pressed on;
there was a ferocious, growling grunt
and a big wild boar, with open jaws and
long yellow tusks, came at him. He made
for a tree and scrambled up into its
branches. He heard a suppressed laugh;
his panic-stricken climb could not have
been other than ludicrous to an on-looker;
he glanced all round but could see no
one through the curtain of leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where the devil is she?&#8221; he said, in
English, his voice louder than he thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>&#8220;Here,&#8221; came the reply, also in English;
&#8220;the third tree to your right&mdash;the lowest
limb.&#8221;</p>

<p>He now saw a pair of laced boots with
high tops and the edge of a brown cloth
walking-skirt. &#8220;Those feet look promising,&#8221;
he thought, as he watched them
swinging cheerfully. He crawled farther
out on the big limb. When he paused again
he could see her waist; a brown silk sash
with tasselled ends was wrapped several
times round it. He could also see one
of her hands; she had her glove off and
the hand was as promising as the feet.
He crawled a little farther. Pausing again,
he peered out; he was looking into the
charming, amused face of Her Serene
Highness! She recognized him instantly.
She tried to sober her features, but the
spectacle of this dignified young man on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
all fours craning his neck at her through
the leaves was too much for her gravity.
She began to laugh, and, as he instinctively
released one hand, took off his hat
and bowed, she became almost hysterical.</p>

<p>He swung himself round and found a
secure sitting from which he could view
her. She said: &#8220;I beg your pardon;
I&#8217;m so&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me,&#8221; he said, good-humoredly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s most becoming to you to
laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>She straightened her face and elaborately
brought forward a look designed to
&#8220;put him in his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer the laughter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Posing
isn&#8217;t a bit becoming to you&mdash;not a bit.
You seem to have the habit of drawing
me into disagreeable situations and then
putting on airs. Who invited me down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
that passage-way at Paquin&#8217;s? Who dropped
her handkerchief twice in my path
and suspected me of flirtation? Who summoned
me to come and amuse her by being
chased by a wild boar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I told you to stop,&#8221; she protested,
feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather late, wasn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m not complaining.
It&#8217;s delightful to have the
chances fate has given me. But I strongly
object to your blaming me for fate&#8217;s
fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are rude,&#8221; she said, hotly. &#8220;You
are taking an unfair advantage of my
helpless position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray calm yourself,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;All I ask of you is ordinary civility or
silence. I certainly have no desire to
thrust myself upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both were silent and sat watching the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
boar as it ranged frantically from one
tree to the other, pausing at each to look
up with an insane gleam in its wicked,
little, blood-shot eyes. After fifteen minutes
Grafton moved slowly back towards
the fork of the tree. As he reached
it and seemed about to descend, she said,
in a humble tone that made him smile inwardly,
&#8220;Where are you going, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make a dash for a rifle
I see on the ground,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t&mdash;you mustn&#8217;t. I forbid
it!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any suggestion to offer
as to how we are to escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied, reluctantly, &#8220;except
to call out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And bring somebody else to make
an amusing spectacle of himself&mdash;if he
doesn&#8217;t happen to get killed. I can&#8217;t congratulate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
you on your scheme.&#8221; And he
continued his descent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop; for God&#8217;s sake, stop!&#8221; she called
out. &#8220;I am ashamed of myself. I am
sufficiently punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear young lady, I&#8217;m not punishing
you; I&#8217;m trying to get myself, and
incidentally you, out of this mess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;<i>please</i>&mdash;come back where I can
see you; I wish to say something to you.&#8221;
It was certainly Erica and not Her Serene
Highness who was speaking now.</p>

<p>He obeyed her. When he could see her
again he said, &#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I want you to say that you forgive
me,&#8221; she said, earnestly. &#8220;I want to see
that you forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in a friendly way.
&#8220;I understand how it is with you. I
don&#8217;t in the least blame you. Only,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
in my country, we never permit any one
to take that tone towards us. And now,
please, Your Majesty of the Oak Tree,
may I go for the rifle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I say that you mustn&#8217;t?&#8221; she
asked, a smile in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have a reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in the first place&#8221;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&#8220;it
isn&#8217;t loaded.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her searchingly. She
blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it your rifle?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I always carry it when I walk
in the woods; there&#8217;s a chance that something
disagreeable might escape from the
forest into the park, though the fences are
strong and high. And to-day when the
boar came at me&#8221;&mdash;she looked as though
she felt very foolish&mdash;&#8220;my foot caught
and&mdash;I dropped the rifle.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t load it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked still more confused. &#8220;No,
I&#8217;m not so silly as that. It is loaded,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re always making me
apologize to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or is it that I make you feel like apologizing
to yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that is it,&#8221; she admitted.
&#8220;But&mdash;<i>please</i> don&#8217;t go down for the rifle.&#8221;
She looked at the boar&mdash;its thin, powerful
body, its vicious green eyes, its greedy,
raw mouth&mdash;how those tusks and those
pointed hoofs could tear and rip and
mangle! Then she looked at the handsome,
calmly courageous young American.
&#8220;<i>Please</i>,&#8221; she begged. &#8220;If anything
should go wrong with you, think
how it would make me suffer, for I got
you into this danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a better plan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
climb through on the branches until I was
directly over the gun. Then you could
distract the brute&#8217;s attention by swinging
your sash just over his nose. I could
jump and grab the gun; I&#8217;d have plenty
of time to aim and kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds very&mdash;unsafe,&#8221; she objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, it will do no harm for me
to get as near the gun as possible,&#8221; he said.
And he began to crawl along a branch
in the general direction of the rifle. The
boar noted the movement and followed
him underneath, snapping its fangs at
him, the froth flowing from its ragged
lips. Erica watched, her eyes wide, her
face gray with dread. Crash! a branch
gave way under him. He fell, and so low
was he before he could stop himself that
one of his feet, clad in a heavy shoe, kicked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
the boar in the nose. She, seeing him
begin to fall, screamed and turned about
to descend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he drew
himself up into the tree. &#8220;I&#8217;m all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>She clambered back just as the boar,
dashing for her, flung itself high up the
trunk. He looked at her, saw that her
eyes were closed and that she was trembling.
&#8220;Are you going to faint?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Quick, unwind your sash and
fasten yourself in the tree with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t faint. Oh,
what a weak, cowardly creature I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; His look and his tone brought
the color to her cheeks and a pleased look
to her eyes. &#8220;You, who were coming down
when you thought the boar had me? You
are the bravest girl I ever saw. You can
be counted on.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>He remembered the boar and again set
out along the branches. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be more
careful,&#8221; he called, over his shoulder.
Soon he was within six feet of the rifle
and directly above it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what will you do?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that we&#8217;re any better off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patience,&#8221; he replied. He broke off a
branch and lowered it towards the ground;
it reached. He slowly pushed the rifle towards
the base of the tree. The boar backed
away and eyed the moving branch suspiciously.
Grafton had got the rifle against
the trunk before the boar rushed. He
flung the branch far out from the tree,
and the boar leaped into it and trampled
and tore it, paying no attention to the
rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please unwind your sash,&#8221;
said Grafton, &#8220;and tease him with it?&mdash;keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the end just out of reach of his nose.
While you do that I&#8217;ll jump down the other
side of the tree and shoot him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She unwound the long brown sash and
let down one of its tasselled ends. The
boar rushed it several times, then came to
a halt under it, prancing round and round,
jumping into the air, frothing and snapping
its tusks. Grafton watched until
he could see that it was dizzy from rage
and rapid whirling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shout!&#8221; he called to her. &#8220;Shout at
him and shake the scarf.&#8221;</p>

<p>She obeyed. He dropped to the ground,
snatched the rifle, took quick aim, and
fired. The boar was leaping into the air.
When it fell, it fell to its side, dead&mdash;there
was not even a quiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come till I make sure,&#8221; he called,
running towards the carcass. Down upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
it fluttered the brown sash, and then came
a heavier body&mdash;Erica herself.</p>

<p>Grafton put his arms about her and stood
up, holding her as if she were a child.
Her long lashes lifted and she looked into
his eyes with a faint, apologetic smile.
&#8220;Put me down, please,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not just yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make an
effort, and you&#8217;ll come round more quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and relaxed into his
arms. &#8220;How strong he is!&#8221; she thought.
&#8220;And how brave! How glad I am to see
him again, to find that he&#8217;s just as I&#8217;ve
been suspecting he&#8217;d be!&#8221; At this a little
color came into her cheeks.</p>

<p>He, not dreaming what was going on in
her romantic young mind, was looking
down at her, trying to keep a very tender
smile out of his face&mdash;she looked so like
a sleeping, spoiled child, with her child&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
complexion, her short upper lip, her round,
aggressive little chin. Her skin was so
fine that he could see the blood pulsing
through the delicate tracery of the veins
in her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; she said, after a few
seconds. He let her feet down, but still
held her about the shoulders. He led her
to a fallen tree, and they sat, she leaning
against him, he holding her firmly in his
arm. Soon she could sit alone, her elbows
on her knees, her chin between her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an American; so you said at&mdash;at
Paquin&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and so are you&mdash;almost. You
look and speak and act like an American
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had an American governess. And my
father&#8217;s&mdash;second wife was an American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
an American just now. I feel as if we
both belonged here&mdash;in this wilderness&mdash;as
if I had known you all the always
I could remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat up and smiled, dreamily, sympathetically,
without looking at him. &#8220;I
was just thinking,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
even know your name, yet I feel as if
I knew you as well as I have ever known
any one.&#8221; She sighed. &#8220;I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught him looking longingly at
her, and they both blushed and were embarrassed.
&#8220;My name is Grafton&mdash;Frederick
Grafton,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And mine is Erica.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that much&mdash;Erica what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all, except several other Christian
names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how are you distinguished from
other Ericas?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>&#8220;Well, they might call me Erica of
Zweitenbourg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your name is the same as your
uncle&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t his name, nor mine.
He&#8217;s Grand Duke of Zweitenbourg, and
we&#8217;re of the younger line&mdash;the ducal branch.
Our family is Traubenheim. We came
here about four hundred years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your name is Erica Traubenheim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; Erica <i>of</i> Traubenheim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Erica Traubenheimer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, no! That&#8217;s a dreadful
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said Grafton.
&#8220;It&#8217;s as though I should call myself Frederick
of Grafton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is it; only in your country you
write your names differently. I was talking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
to the American minister about it;
he explained that you have your noble
families as we do, only they don&#8217;t reign,
but hold aloof from politics, except to
accept the high appointments of state.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton laughed. &#8220;Did he tell you
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I knew at once that you were
of a noble family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A noble family of&mdash;dress-fitters?&#8221;</p>

<p>Erica blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father was a pork-packer,&#8221; continued
Grafton. &#8220;And his father was a
pork-packer, and before that a farmer,
and&mdash;I had an aunt who was crazy on
genealogy; she found out that we were
descended from a blacksmith. And my
mother&#8217;s grandfather was a carpenter&mdash;when
he could get carpentering to do.
We&#8217;re all like that in America.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>&#8220;It must be very&mdash;very queer.&#8221; She
seemed disappointed, depressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every country seems queer to every
other. This country seems queer to me.
Do you really like it&mdash;that life at The
Castle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it seemed to me that if I were
caught in such a routine&mdash;having to live
my life on a plan fixed hundreds of years
ago&mdash;never allowed to be my natural human
self&mdash;it seems to me I&#8217;d die of weariness,
unless I were imbecile or became so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t mind it if you&#8217;d been
educated for it.&#8221; She thought for a few
minutes, then said: &#8220;Unfortunately, I
wasn&#8217;t. My father&#8217;s&mdash;second wife persuaded
him to educate me in the modern
way. That makes this life almost impossible
for me; it seems narrow and unreal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
and useless. And it&#8217;s so dull, so deadly
dull!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get out of it&mdash;break
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman is helpless. Besides, I&#8217;m not
sure&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and put on her Tyrol hat and
wrapped her brown sash about her waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll walk with you as far as the road,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I could find it
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they went, both silent and she constrained,
he noted that she watched him
curiously, as it seemed to him, critically,
whenever she thought he was not seeing.
They came to the cross-road and he asked,
&#8220;When am I to see you again?&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed painfully. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid
it&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put out his hand. She hesitated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
then gave him hers. &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that wasn&#8217;t what I meant,&#8221; he
explained, clasping her hand. She made
a faint effort to draw it away, then let it
lie in his. &#8220;Impossible, you say? Then
you don&#8217;t wish to let me see you again?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hung her head. &#8220;No; not that. I
do wish it. But it&#8217;s impossible&mdash;I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped her hand. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>They walked slowly on. She felt him
going&mdash;going out of her life. She could
not endure it. She said: &#8220;But&#8221;&mdash;she
colored and kept her eyes down&mdash;&#8220;I&mdash;I
walk here nearly every afternoon at
three o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that fortunate!&#8221; he said. &#8220;So
do I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their faces showed how happy they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
were. They came out of the woods into
the main road and lingered over the parting.
They parted like friends at the beginning
of a promising friendship&mdash;a
promising man-and-woman friendship.
He stood looking after her, and as he
was turning away found her handkerchief
where she had stood. He picked it up,
kissed it with a gentle smile of self-mockery,
and put it carefully in the breast-pocket
of his coat. &#8220;And I thought I
came here for the Grand Duke&#8217;s Spaniard!&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT luncheon the next day the
Grand Duke was in one of
his tantrums. He sneered at
Erica and the ladies of the
court, he insulted the gentlemen-in-waiting
and the heads of the royal household,
he cursed the servants. As usual,
he ate enormously; as usual, his face grew
redder and redder; as usual, his temper
rose as the luncheon progressed. At first
the others made some attempts to start
and carry a conversation. But finding
that to speak was to make one&#8217;s self a target
for sneer and jeer, all became silent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Erica endured with unprecedented meekness.
Her thoughts were far away, and
she had a feeling about her immediate
surroundings which she did not attempt
to explain to herself&mdash;a feeling that they
were slowly fading from her real life.</p>

<p>When he could eat no more, Casimir
pushed back his chair from the table and
lighted a cigar. &#8220;Was ever man damned
to such a life as this!&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;Surrounded
by chuckleheads and numskulls,
we go through life cracking our jaws with
yawning. And here you sit or stand,
mute, smirking, and bowing us on towards
insanity!&#8221; He looked savagely round.
&#8220;Well!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;has nobody anything
to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>All except Erica were trembling. They
were accustomed to these outbursts; they
knew that their lives and limbs were safe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
But their sovereign was thundering, and
it was their duty to fear and tremble.
Besides, they might lose their places at
court, might be banished from its glory,
might be deprived of the honor and the
happiness of receiving these humiliations
and insults from exalted rank.</p>

<p>Choking with rage, Casimir rose and
stamped from the room. In his cabinet
he flung himself on a sofa and cursed and
ground his cigar between his teeth. As
he had never in his life been curbed, and
as there was no public opinion to control
him, no standard of private conduct to
constrain him, he acted precisely as he
felt, when he was not posing before the
people. He despised the people, of course;
but they paid the taxes, and they paid
because they believed him a superior being,
a shepherd without whom they, the lowly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
flock, would be in a miserable plight. He
was most careful to keep up appearances
before them, to do nothing that would discourage
their loyalty to the throne, their
tolerance of its tax-gatherers.</p>

<p>The cause of Casimir&#8217;s present outburst
was Grafton&#8217;s failure to keep his
appointment. &#8220;Has he gone away?&#8221;
thought Casimir. &#8220;Or is he playing on
my notorious craze for Rembrandts?&#8221; He
sent his personal servant to the H&ocirc;tel de
l&#8217;Europe privately to inquire. When he
learned that Grafton was still there he
began to fear that he was mistaken in
thinking he had come to Zweitenbourg
with a definite purpose. How to reopen
the negotiation&mdash;that was the question.</p>

<p>He sent for Erica. &#8220;Read!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;No; talk! Are you glad Aloyse is coming
to-night?&#8221; This with a sneer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>&#8220;I had forgotten it,&#8221; replied Erica,
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgotten it? Forgotten your sweetheart?
Forgotten! Haven&#8217;t you seen this
morning&#8217;s <i>Gazette</i>? It&#8217;s a love-match, the
<i>Gazette</i> says, &#8216;The handsome and brilliant
heir to the throne and his beautiful cousin
have been lovers since childhood.&#8217;&#8221; Casimir
laughed harshly. &#8220;Love! And you
could forget my high-spirited, handsome,
intellectual heir? Wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had an adventure in the park yesterday
that I&#8217;ve been thinking about ever
since,&#8221; said Erica. And she went on to
tell the story of the boar, saying as little
as possible of Grafton, and being careful
to put that little prudently.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke was so interested that
he sat up, forgot his indigestion and his
boredom and his departed youth. &#8220;And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
who was this man?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;He
must be rewarded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American,&#8221; replied Erica. &#8220;A&mdash;a&mdash;I
think he said his name was Graf
something&mdash;yes, Grafton.&#8221; She concealed
her delight at the success of her plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grafton!&#8221; The Grand Duke leaped to
his feet and paced the floor excitedly. He
rang a bell and told the servant to send
Baron Zeppstein to him, then continued
his impatient walk and his muttering
until Zeppstein stood before him, bent
double in a bow. &#8220;Baron,&#8221; he said, &#8220;go
at once to the H&ocirc;tel de l&#8217;Europe and present
our compliments to a Mr. Grafton
who is there, and tell him that we have
commanded his presence at once. We
wish to thank him for having saved the
life of Her Serene Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erica was radiant. She took her uncle&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
shrivelled hand, courtesied, and kissed it.
&#8220;You are so good,&#8221; she said, gratefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good? Nonsense! He&#8217;s one of those
Americans who pay enormous prices for
pictures and take them away from us to
that barbarous republic and they&#8217;re never
seen by civilized eyes again. He&#8217;s got
two pictures that I want. Your adventure
gives me the chance to get hold of
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erica went to the door. &#8220;Stay here,
child,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I wish to talk at somebody.
I must give the fellow something&mdash;the
Order of the Green Hawk will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you give that to hotel-keepers
when you stay at their hotels and to tradesmen
who make you presents of goods
you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough; he won&#8217;t know the difference,
and he&#8217;ll be beside himself with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
delight; it takes little to tickle a democrat.
But how shall I bring up the subject
of the pictures?&mdash;that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m considering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would be tactful to
speak of them at the first meeting,&#8221; said
Erica. &#8220;You might invite him to dinner,
or&mdash;to luncheon to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is an idea. He&#8217;s a well-appearing
person and interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen him?&#8221; Erica looked
the amazement she felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talked with him for three hours yesterday,&#8221;
replied her uncle. Then he
laughed. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be surprised when he
sees that the keeper of the galleries is
the Grand Duke. I let him think I was
the keeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Zeppstein had found Grafton
at the H&ocirc;tel de l&#8217;Europe, dejectedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
preparing to leave. When he explained
his mission, Grafton at first flatly refused.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve changed my mind,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
wish to get away from here on the next
train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear Mr. Grafton, think of
the honor&mdash;His Royal Highness proposes
in person to thank you! And&mdash;I don&#8217;t
wish to raise false hopes, but I&#8217;m confident
he will decorate you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m overwhelmed!&#8221; said Grafton. &#8220;I
should die of joy; I must not go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeppstein looked suspicious of mockery,
then decided that he was mistaken, and
went on with his pleadings. &#8220;His Royal
Highness can be most gracious. He will
not make you feel the difference in station.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he talked Grafton was not listening
but reflecting. On impulse he decided
to go. &#8220;Why not see her again?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
he thought. &#8220;I can feel no worse.&#8221; His
mind made up, he pretended reluctantly
to yield. &#8220;I&#8217;ll waive the etiquette of the
occasion, I think,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The etiquette? Pardon me; I do not
follow you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the Grand Duke should have
called first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Grafton&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he only a grand duke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, may I ask, what are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton looked cautiously about. &#8220;A
king,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want it
known.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeppstein grew nervous. &#8220;You Americans
are great jesters,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;re all kings, but we don&#8217;t use
the title; it&#8217;s too common at home and too
troublesome abroad. However, I&#8217;ll overlook
the difference in our rank. Lead on!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>On the way Zeppstein gave him detailed
instructions in how to behave himself.
&#8220;I shall probably be permitted to conduct
you only to the door of the cabinet,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You must knock quietly and
enter at once without waiting for an answer.
As soon as you are inside the door,
draw it shut behind you, but don&#8217;t turn
round in doing so. You must be facing
His Royal Highness and making a bow,
head on a level with the loins, until he
speaks. You might have your right hand
ungloved. His Royal Highness may in
the circumstances be graciously pleased
to give you his hand to shake. If he
should decorate you, you must sink to
your knees, and when he has put the decoration
over your bowed head you must
kiss his hand&mdash;place the back of your
right hand under his palm and kiss respectfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
but not lingeringly. Be sure
your lips are dry. His Royal Highness
has a horror of being touched by damp
lips. Be careful what you say; it is
wisest to answer as briefly as possible
such questions as His Royal Highness
may be graciously pleased to ask. And
don&#8217;t say &#8216;you&#8217; to him, always &#8216;Your
Royal Highness.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when I leave&mdash;do I walk, wriggle,
or crawl?&#8221; asked Grafton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Walk backwards,&#8221; said Zeppstein.
&#8220;Only members of the cabinet wriggle
in and out on their knees, and they only
when they&#8217;re sworn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I think that&#8217;s too self-respecting,&#8221;
replied Grafton. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll crawl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear Mr. Grafton, it is against
all precedent. We haven&#8217;t crawled for
several centuries.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll revive the fashion. This is a bumptious
generation; it should be taught humility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir, I beg that you will not
crawl; you would bring disgrace upon me.
I should be suspected of having so instructed
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To oblige you, I&#8217;ll try to forego the
pleasure of treating a sovereign as a sovereign
should be treated. But it will be a
sacrifice.&#8221;</p>

<p>When their names were sent up, the
command came for both together. &#8220;Now,&#8221;
whispered Zeppstein, as they stood at the
door of the cabinet, &#8220;don&#8217;t forget my instructions.&#8221;
He knocked and got his hips
and shoulders ready for his presence-bow.
&#8220;You must enter first,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>Grafton walked in. The Grand Duke
was standing facing the door with Erica<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
a few feet away to his left. Grafton advanced
towards Erica. &#8220;His Royal Highness
first,&#8221; whispered Zeppstein, plucking
at his sleeve.</p>

<p>Grafton went on to Erica and put out
his hand. &#8220;How d&#8217;ye do?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad to see you again.&#8221; But his face was
sad and his voice lifeless. He turned to
the Grand Duke. They shook hands, and
the Grand Duke laughed familiarly. Baron Zeppstein
stood aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her Serene Highness has been telling
me&mdash;&#8221; began the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Baron Zeppstein here explained
to me,&#8221; interrupted Grafton. &#8220;But it was
nothing; your niece was in no danger&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeppstein had sidled behind him and
now whispered, &#8220;Not &#8216;you,&#8217; but &#8216;Your
Royal Highness,&#8217; not &#8216;your niece,&#8217; but &#8216;Her
Serene Highness,&#8217; and <i>don&#8217;t</i> interrupt!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s Zeppstein whispering?&#8221; asked
the Grand Duke, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very kindly instructing me in etiquette,
but&#8221;&mdash;here Grafton hesitated, with
a twinkle in his eyes&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve been so differently
bred in America that I fear I&#8217;m not
reflecting credit upon him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke waved his hand at
Zeppstein. &#8220;Take yourself off,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t send him away,&#8221;
interposed Grafton. &#8220;He&#8217;s to blame for
me being here. It was his talk in Paris
about your Rembrandts that made me
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to suspect that you
knew me yesterday,&#8221; said Casimir.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did; but I thought I&#8217;d humor your
desire to be unknown. We could talk
more freely.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke took from the table<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
the ribbon and medal of the Order of the
Green Hawk, and held it as if he expected
Grafton to kneel to receive it. Grafton
stretched out his hand for it. The Grand
Duke smiled as he gave it to him, and
chuckled when Grafton, saying, &#8220;Thank
you; it is very nice; a great honor; more
than I deserve, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; put it in his
pocket. Erica turned away to the window,
her shoulders shaking violently.</p>

<p>After a few minutes&#8217; talk, Grafton rose
to take his leave. Zeppstein frowned at
him to wait until the Grand Duke rose to
indicate that the audience was at an end.
The Grand Duke said, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you lunch
with us very informally to-morrow, at
two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied Grafton; &#8220;but I
have arranged to go on the night train to
Ostend.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>&#8220;There is a matter&mdash;some pictures&mdash;I&#8217;d
much like to talk with you about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton hesitated. His wandering
glance noted Erica&#8217;s face and its expression.
&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said to Casimir,
&#8220;I can easily change my plans.&#8221; And to
himself he said: &#8220;Why not? I may at
least, get my Spaniard.&#8221;</p>

<p>After leaving &#8220;the presence,&#8221; Grafton
extricated himself from Zeppstein as quickly
as possible, which was not so quickly as
he would have liked. He set out alone for
the walk to town. A quarter of a mile
along that quiet, beautiful road and he
saw Erica coming towards him by a side-path.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am late in my walk to-day,&#8221; she
began, with shy friendliness. &#8220;You are
going&mdash;perhaps to-morrow? I may not
see you.&#8221; In spite of herself her voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
trembled. &#8220;I wish to thank you again,
to wish you&mdash;all happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went down the side-path together.
&#8220;I can think of nothing to say,&#8221; he said
at last, in a dreary tone. &#8220;I have had
bad news.&#8221;</p>

<p>She instinctively came nearer and looked
up at him with quick sympathy. &#8220;Is it
a death&mdash;some one you loved?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one I loved&mdash;yes,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;But not death&mdash;worse, I think&mdash;worse
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me; I did not mean to intrude&mdash;to
hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the one to apologize; I ought
not to have intruded my sorrow. Let me
speak of your happiness. I read in the
<i>Gazette</i> this morning that your engagement
is about to be announced&mdash;that you
are marrying some one you have loved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
since childhood. I wish you happiness.
I&#8217;m glad that you are getting your heart&#8217;s
desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed; it sounded very like a sigh
of relief. She seated herself on a rustic
bench and he sat beside her. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
understand how it is with us,&#8221; she said,
after a long pause. &#8220;I am marrying my
cousin. It is not a love-match; we care
nothing each for the other. That is the
way everything is with us&mdash;never for ourselves,
always for the house, for the state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trash!&#8221; he ejaculated, bitterly. &#8220;Of
course I don&#8217;t understand; there&#8217;s nothing
to understand. It&#8217;s all pretence and lies,
vain show, theatrical nonsense. We belong
to the present, not to the childish,
ignorant past. Now, I suppose I&#8217;ve offended
you; I regret it, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m not offended. I almost agree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
with you. Then&mdash;my surroundings, my
inheritance are too strong for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you had only a day to live,&#8221;
he burst out. &#8220;Suppose you knew that
you would die at sunset to-morrow&mdash;wink
out, vanish, be gone forever, pass away
utterly. Would you spend your one day
of life in such fooleries as these?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;No, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well; you have in reality only one
day&mdash;your little span of life in the stretch
of eternity. You must do the best you
can with it; you won&#8217;t get another. You
must enjoy it; you will never have a chance
to enjoy another. You must be happy
and contented and useful in it; to-morrow
you vanish. And you tell me you&#8217;re going
to spend it with a man you don&#8217;t love,
spend it in this cold, empty, silly life of
kissing hands and bowing and strutting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
of vanity and gilt. What a life&mdash;what a
miserable, degrading death-in-life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; she repeated,
with a suggestion of haughtiness or attempt
at haughtiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, do you? There you sit&mdash;young,
beautiful, a woman with love and passion
in her eyes, a woman to be loved, to
be happy, and to make others happy. And
you think yourself superior&mdash;you who propose
to spend your life in a way that&mdash;I&#8217;d
hate to characterize it. Why did God
give you beauty and brains and a common-sense
education? Why did He bring
you into the world a queen&mdash;not a toy
queen, not a figurehead of a &#8216;house,&#8217; but
a real, royal queen&mdash;queen by the true,
divine right? In order that you should
act like a slave? That you should be dazzled
by spangles like a vulgar peasant&mdash;play<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
all your life with puppets like a
child&mdash;be a puppet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say these things to me?&#8221;
She looked at him sadly, all the haughtiness
gone from her face and voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I love you; that is why.
Because I know&mdash;it is useless for you to
deny it&mdash;that you would like to love me&mdash;if
you dared.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her bosom rose and fell rapidly. &#8220;Is
it true?&#8221; she said, looking at him with a
thirsty longing in her eyes. &#8220;Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it matter?&#8221; He shrugged
his shoulders. &#8220;I not only love you but
I would win you, if you had&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had what? Say it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both were silent a long time. He laughed
bitterly, and said: &#8220;When I was a
boy there used to be in one of our school-books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the story of a man who went down
in a shipwreck because he would not give
up the bag of gold that was strapped to
him. There was a silly moral; I forget
it. But how human what he did was!
How many human beings there are who
drown their real selves because they won&#8217;t
cut away some dead weight of false pride
or false glory or gold or conventionality&mdash;&#8221;
He rose abruptly. &#8220;Let us go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am dragging you down into my
unhappiness because I won&#8217;t throw away
my dead weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not for you to consider. Your
own case is quite enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I lack courage, or I am too foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you; don&#8217;t think that
I do. You&#8217;d probably be unhappy after
you&#8217;d given up. I&#8217;ve thought of that. If
I hadn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carry you off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; She stood before
him, looking eagerly up into his face. &#8220;I
wish to have my mind made up for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I! You must decide for yourself.&#8221;
He stood very close to her. &#8220;But&mdash;how
I love you! Not because you are a Traubenheim
instead of only a Traubenheimer;
not for the reasons that seem to count
most with you; but just for the sake of
your wonderful self that has dazzled me
into this folly of loving you, dear&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; go on,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>There was the clatter of many hoofs
on the main road; they were only a few
yards from it. A brilliant cavalcade swept
by; a young man in a gaudy field-marshal&#8217;s
uniform, followed by a dozen officers
in blue and white, with glittering helmets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
and cuirasses; after them several companies
of the Household Guards.</p>

<p>&#8220;My cousin,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>From the direction of The Castle came
the booming of cannon and then the strains
of a military band. Frederick and Erica
stood, neither looking at the other. He
began to walk towards the main road and
she reluctantly followed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; he said, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That is&mdash;until
to-morrow. You will come here at
four&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was the sound of a horse at a
gallop and soon round the bend of the
road swept the young man in the field-marshal&#8217;s
uniform. He looked a giant,
in his tall helmet surmounted by three
huge white plumes. He reined his horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
near Grafton and Erica, and flung himself
from the saddle. Grafton saw that
he was not tall, but short; not broad, but
narrow&mdash;that his imposing appearance had
been due wholly to his uniform. Also
it was apparent that he was in a fury.
Leaving the horse, he stalked towards them,
his sword clanking against his spurs.
Erica was pale and nervous. If Grafton
had been looking at her he would have
seen that she watched her cousin with an
expression of aversion.</p>

<p>Aloyse stepped on a loose stone and it
slipped. His sword swung round and
caught between his short legs. He tripped,
toppled, plunged forward and, as his helmet
flew off, his face ploughed into the
dust. He was lying prostrate at Erica&#8217;s
feet.</p>

<p>Grafton sprang to him and lifted him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
up and set him on his legs. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;re
not hurt?&#8221; he said, with perfect self-control.</p>

<p>Aloyse&#8217;s hair, mustache, eyes, and
mouth were full of dust, his uniform was
coated with it. &#8220;Go to the devil!&#8221; he
exclaimed, turning his back on Grafton
and wiping his face with a handkerchief
he drew from his sleeve. &#8220;Who is this
person?&#8221; he demanded of Erica, in German.
&#8220;And what are you doing here?
I saw you hiding in the woods as I came
by.&#8221; He spoke to her as if she were his
property, and anger flamed in her cheeks
and sparkled in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to seem a gentleman,&#8221; she whispered
to him, in German. Then she turned
to Grafton. &#8220;Mr. Grafton,&#8221; she said, in
English, &#8220;my cousin, the Inheriting Grand
Duke.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>Grafton bowed coldly. Aloyse looked
at him insolently from head to foot. &#8220;Take
yourself off,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Grafton&#8217;s eyes blazed. He put out his
hand to Erica. &#8220;I shall see you at luncheon
to-morrow.&#8221; As Erica was about to shake
hands with him, Aloyse struck his hand up.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of your impertinence. Be off!&#8221;
he said, his weak, blond face ridiculous
with rage and dust.</p>

<p>Grafton brought his hand down on
Aloyse&#8217;s shoulder and closed his fingers.
Aloyse shivered, winced, bit his lips till
the blood came to crush back a howl of
pain. Grafton set him to one side and released
him. Then he shook hands with
Erica, lifted his hat, and walked away.
Aloyse and Erica stood looking after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>hate</i> him,&#8221; thought Aloyse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>love</i> him,&#8221; thought Erica.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT ten the next morning there
was excitement in the hotel&mdash;the
Inheriting Grand Duke had
come, had sent up his card to
the American gentleman, and the American
gentleman, instead of descending, had
told the servant to &#8220;show him up.&#8221; The
Inheriting Grand Duke was in top-hat and
long coat. He was looking insignificant,
sheepish, and surly.</p>

<p>When Grafton&#8217;s sitting-room door was
closed behind him, he bowed stiffly and said,
&#8220;At the command of His Royal Highness,
I have come to apologize to you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>Grafton waved his hand. &#8220;Say no
more about it. I thought your father
wouldn&#8217;t approve of such a performance.
I regret, for your sake, that you didn&#8217;t
come on your own account. Is that
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the command of His Royal Highness
I say that we shall be pleased to see
you at luncheon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell your father I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221; Grafton
looked significantly at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;On my own account, I say that, after
you have finished your affair with His
Royal Highness, I have a matter which
one of my officers, Prince von Moltzahn,
will bring to your attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I may assure His Royal Highness
that you will be at luncheon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Good-morning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>Aloyse bowed stiffly, and pompously left
the room.</p>

<p>When Grafton reached The Castle it was
apparent to him that there had been a
storm, doubtless a quarrel between the
Grand Duke and his son.</p>

<p>Luncheon was served in a huge, clammily
cool chamber of state. Conversation
was all but impossible, so elaborate were
the ceremonies of feeding the Grand Duke.
Each dish for him was passed from servant
to servant in ascending order, and then
from gentleman-in-waiting to gentleman-in-waiting
in ascending rank until at last
it was set before His Royal Highness.
After he had been served, the others were
served with almost equal elaboration of
ceremony&mdash;Aloyse before Erica, and Grafton,
by special courtesy, immediately after
her, to the irritation of the ladies and gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of the court whose rank in the royal
household gave them seats at the royal
luncheon-table. Grafton watched the tedious
ceremonies, marvelling that any one
would tolerate them day after day and year
after year. Erica and Aloyse sat gazing
into their plates and did not speak. The
Grand Duke fussed and blustered over his
food, and ate greedily, with much smacking
of lips, between mouthfuls asking questions
about America.</p>

<p>It was half-past three when he rose
and said to Grafton, &#8220;We will smoke in
my apartment.&#8221; Grafton followed him
through five or six enormous rooms, all
gaudily decorated, all clammy cool, all
impossible as human habitations. They
ascended a stairway down which fifteen
men might have marched abreast. They
came to a mezzanine floor, and, dodging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
under a low beam, went along a dark passage-way.
It ended in a small, low-ceilinged
room plainly furnished, every article
showing signs of long and hard usage.
There was much dust and an odor of stuffy
staleness, and the heat was intense.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s where I live,&#8221; said the Grand
Duke, dropping to a ragged old lounge
with a sigh of pleasure and lighting a
pipe. &#8220;I have to have some place where I
can be comfortable.&#8221; The pipe was old
and strong, the windows were tight shut.
&#8220;I always feel cold after eating,&#8221; said the
Grand Duke. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mind the windows
being closed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Grafton, in an unconvincing
tone. It seemed to him that if
he stayed there many minutes he would
faint. &#8220;I suppose it is about my Rembrandts
that you wished to talk to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
me,&#8221; he began, wishing to hasten the
end.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you said about them interested
me greatly,&#8221; replied the Grand Duke. &#8220;I
thought possibly we might come to some
agreement about them&mdash;if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I was attracted by only one picture
in your collection that you could part
with&mdash;the one you bought from Acton&mdash;the
spurious Velasquez. I&#8217;ve always
wanted it&mdash;in fact, I came here to try to
get it. But I&#8217;ve almost lost interest in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is idle to discuss that. I could not
think of giving up the picture; it is one of
my ancestors&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is by no means certain&mdash;as you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I so regard it,&#8221; said Casimir.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will exchange the &#8216;Woman with the
Earrings&#8217; for it,&#8221; continued Grafton.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>&#8220;Come, now, Mr. Grafton. Is that reasonable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can get for it double what you paid
for the Spaniard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will pay you double,&#8221; said Casimir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money would not tempt me. The
Spaniard or nothing. But&mdash;I&#8217;m not well
to-day&mdash;you must excuse me. I can meet
you at the gallery to-morrow at eleven,
or you can let me know what you will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton was overwhelmed by the foul
air of the Grand Duke&#8217;s &#8220;cosey corner&#8221; of
the palace. His plea was the literal truth
and the Grand Duke could see it in his
face. He assented to the appointment for
the following morning, and Grafton hurriedly
made his escape.</p>

<p>He felt that within the next few minutes
he would be at his life-crisis.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>Another bend of the road and the park
gates would be in view. And still no
Erica. He was about to turn back when
she called him from an obscure side-path.
As his eyes met hers his heart leaped&mdash;he
knew that he had won.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have been following me,&#8221; she
said, in a low tone. &#8220;Quick; come with
me.&#8221; She darted into the wilderness, he
close behind her. They wound in and
out through a tangle of paths which only
one thoroughly familiar with the park
would have known as paths. At last
they came to a fallen tree in a thicket so
dense that it was barely lighted, although
sunset was four hours away.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are safe,&#8221; she said, her eyes brilliant.</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms. &#8220;It seems
to me that I loved you the instant I saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
you. And I shall not give you up. We
will go away to my country&mdash;to our country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You have
opened a gate I&#8217;ve often looked at, and I
see beyond it the paradise I&#8217;ve dreamed of.
And I must follow you. I care only for
you. I&#8221;&mdash;she had a very wonderful expression
in her eyes&mdash;&#8220;I love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see the Grand Duke to-morrow
morning. I shall tell him. He will&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must try to understand, dear.
He will never consent. Can&#8217;t you see how
he would look at it? And under the law
he has absolute control of me for five years
yet&mdash;until I am twenty-five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he will release you when he knows
that you do not love his son, that you are
determined to marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; there is but one way. We must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
go across the Swiss border; there I shall
be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the sooner the better. Let us go
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to-night. What is that&mdash;listen!
No&mdash;this way&mdash;come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless,&#8221; called a man&#8217;s voice
from the direction in which they started,
and immediately a young officer appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince von Moltzahn!&#8221; exclaimed
Erica. She drew herself up haughtily.
&#8220;You are insolent, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Serene Highness, I am obeying
orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve caught you,&#8221; came in Aloyse&#8217;s
voice behind them. He was advancing
upon Grafton with his sword drawn. His
eyes looked murder.</p>

<p>Erica darted between them. &#8220;Aloyse!
Would you attack an unarmed man?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>&#8220;Stand aside!&#8221; foamed Aloyse.</p>

<p>She advanced upon him and caught
his sword. &#8220;Give it to me,&#8221; she commanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let go! Let go!&#8221; he said, wildly.
&#8220;I wish to kill him&mdash;the scum&mdash;the vermin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to make yourself infamous,&#8221;
she replied, still holding the sword.
&#8220;Prince von Moltzahn,&#8221; she called over
her shoulder, &#8220;either hand your sword
to Mr. Grafton or help me disarm this
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moltzahn stood uncertainly, murmuring
something about &#8220;the son of my
sovereign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Release him, Erica,&#8221; said Grafton.
&#8220;He dare not attack me. He&#8217;s had time
to think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erica tugged at the sword, and Aloyse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
yielded it with a great show of reluctance.
&#8220;Now what are you going to do?&#8221; she said,
scornfully. &#8220;Why are you here? Why are
you always making yourself ridiculous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see what I&#8217;ll do. My father
thought I was mistaken yesterday. He&#8217;ll
know better now. Both of you must
come to The Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the greatest pleasure,&#8221; said
Grafton.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go by separate ways,&#8221; continued
Aloyse. &#8220;Erica, von Moltzahn will escort
you. I have a few soldiers at the
end of this path; I&#8217;ve kept them out of
sight, as we want no scandal. After you
are on the way, we&#8217;ll escort this person,&#8221;
with a contemptuous gesture towards
Grafton.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Erica. &#8220;We go together.
Send your soldiers away, Aloyse.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>The Inheriting Grand Duke distended
his chest and began to bluster, but she
cut him short. &#8220;Send them away or
I&#8217;ll send them away myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked to The Castle together,
Erica and Grafton in apparent high spirits,
Aloyse and Moltzahn silent and sullen.
They appeared before the Grand Duke
in his cabinet.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221; he demanded, glowering.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Erica,
gayly. &#8220;Mr. Grafton and I were talking
in the park, and Aloyse and the Prince
suddenly appeared; I think Aloyse had
some soldiers hidden somewhere. And
they insisted on taking Mr. Grafton and
me prisoners and bringing us here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You jackass!&#8221; shouted the Grand Duke
at the Inheriting Grand Duke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>&#8220;Now wait till you hear me, father,&#8221;
whined the Inheriting Grand Duke.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something up between Erica
and this fellow; I know it. He calls her
Erica, and they were hidden in a thicket,
and I saw him kiss her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re stark mad,&#8221; said the Grand
Duke, looking at him disgustedly. &#8220;What
is the matter, Mr. Grafton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess Erica has explained all
that either of us knows,&#8221; replied Grafton,
discreetly.</p>

<p>Aloyse appealed to Moltzahn. &#8220;Am
I not right? Didn&#8217;t he call her Erica
and kiss her? Weren&#8217;t they hid in a
thicket?&#8221;</p>

<p>Moltzahn bowed. &#8220;Your Royal Highness
has given the facts as I can testify.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton, watching the Grand Duke&#8217;s
face closely, saw a change in it which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
instantly corrected. &#8220;The old fox,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;He suspects. What will he
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Casimir looked at Moltzahn black as a
thunder-cloud. &#8220;Liar!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;How
dare you utter such a scandal of Her Serene
Highness?&#8221; Then he turned to Grafton.
&#8220;A thousand pardons, Mr. Grafton. We
trust you will forget this folly. We owe
you an apology. We feel profoundly humiliated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray think no more about it,&#8221; said
Grafton.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon us for the brevity
of our apologies to-day, we beg. Baron
Zeppstein will escort you to your hotel.
And we look forward to the pleasure of
seeing you at the galleries at eleven to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At eleven,&#8221; said Grafton, bowing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Erica as the Grand Duke, taking his arm,
escorted him to the anteroom. They
shook hands, the Grand Duke placing
his left hand cordially, even affectionately,
on Grafton&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>Zeppstein had an abstracted companion
on the drive, and when Grafton was alone
he flung himself on the divan in his sitting-room
and abandoned himself to thoughts
that gave his face an expression of deep
discouragement.</p>

<p>When the Grand Duke returned to his
cabinet, he withered Moltzahn with a
furious look. &#8220;What!&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;Still
here? Be off! You are a loathsome creature.
Don&#8217;t show yourself at court for
three months. And if we ever hear that a
word of this has passed your lips, we&#8217;ll strip
your epaulettes from you before the entire
army and banish you. Out of our sight!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>Moltzahn backed from the room, bowing
and cringing. When he was gone the
Grand Duke turned on his son. &#8220;And
now for you, sir! Apologize to Her Serene
Highness! Say after me&mdash;put your heels
together and bend&mdash;now say: &#8216;Your Serene
Highness, I humbly ask pardon for my infamous
conduct, for my lies, for my insults.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Inheriting Grand Duke repeated
the words in a choked voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; continued the Grand Duke, &#8220;if
you should meet Mr. Grafton again, we
command you to speak to him as one gentleman
to another with whom he is on
friendly terms. Do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Your Royal Highness,&#8221; murmured
his heir.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will withdraw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erica and the Grand Duke were now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
alone. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, indeed, my dear child,
that this has happened.&#8221; He took her
hand affectionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done all that I expected&mdash;more.&#8221;
Erica was blushing and looked
extremely guilty. She felt that Aloyse
and Moltzahn had outrageously insulted
her, but she did not like this reparation on
false pretences. &#8220;I have much to say to
you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-day&mdash;not to-day,&#8221; interrupted
the Grand Duke. &#8220;I am exhausted, my
dear. Go to your apartments and compose
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ERICA went to her wing of The
Castle and sat by a window,
trying to plan the next move.
But her brain was so hot and
her thoughts so rambling that she could
devise nothing. She rang for her maid.
An old woman appeared. &#8220;I rang for
Ernestine,&#8221; said Erica.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Your Serene Highness. Ernestine
has been taken suddenly ill and sent me
in her place. I&#8217;m Greta.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in the old woman&#8217;s face and
manner roused an uneasiness in her. She
went to the outer door of her apartment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
A stupid-looking soldier was on guard
there, marching stiffly to and fro.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on guard,&#8221; he answered, in a mountain
dialect of German which she could
hardly understand.</p>

<p>She started down the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, lady, don&#8217;t make trouble.
I can&#8217;t let you pass.&#8221; He put his hand
on her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me!&#8221; She looked at him
haughtily. &#8220;I am the Duchess Erica.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I know you think so, lady; that&#8217;s
your trouble. Now go back quietly&mdash;do!&#8221;</p>

<p>She returned to her apartment. &#8220;Leave
me,&#8221; she said to the old woman.</p>

<p>Greta retired to the anteroom. &#8220;Out
of the apartment!&#8221; exclaimed Erica. &#8220;I
do not wish you about.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>&#8220;Pardon, Your Serene Highness, but
His Royal Highness has commanded me
not to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erica closed the door of her boudoir.
She paced the floor. &#8220;How helpless I
am!&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I cannot move in
any direction!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Early the next morning Grafton went
to a lawyer&mdash;Fogel, who is conspicuous
in the Zweitenbourg Reichstag as a fierce
anti-monarchist. Grafton professed a student&#8217;s
interest in the laws affecting the
royal prerogative. Fogel was most courteous
and obliging. He explained in detail,
and, when he had ended, Grafton saw that
legally his affair was hopeless. The Grand
Duke was absolute over the members of
his own family and court, except that he
could not inflict the death penalty, nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
could he detain any one in prison for a
longer period than six months without
showing cause before the supreme tribunal&mdash;on
application of a relative of the detained
person.</p>

<p>Grafton thanked Fogel and went mournfully
back to his hotel. He was expecting
every moment a message from the Grand
Duke postponing or breaking his engagement,
but at half-past ten no message had
come. He drove out to The Castle. As he
passed the northwest wing he looked up;
there stood Erica. He saw her make a
gesture as if she were flinging something.
It struck the road just ahead of his carriage.
He told the driver to stop, descended, picked
up a little silver box and with it several
small stones. He sent the stones sailing
one at a time out over the lake. He put
the box in his pocket.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>With the carriage following him, he
walked round The Castle to the galleries
and entered. No one was there; he opened
the box, drew out a small paper: &#8220;I am
a prisoner; my uncle knows. My maid,
Ernestine Wundsch, lives in Emperor Ferdinand
Second Street, No. 643&mdash;over the
bake-shop. I love you; be careful for my
sake. When I escape I shall go to Schaffhausen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thrust the note into his pocket and
came out of the alcove into which he had
withdrawn to make sure of not being spied
upon. Ten minutes passed before the
Grand Duke came in. &#8220;Pardon my tardiness,&#8221;
he said, politely. Grafton noted a
malicious twinkle in his eyes. &#8220;I was
arranging the marriage of my son and my
niece. The days of romance are not dead.
After their little misunderstanding yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
they made it up and&mdash;how hot young
blood is!&mdash;they were all for marrying at
once. I hadn&#8217;t the heart to refuse them.
But&mdash;to our little affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided not to part with my Rembrandts,&#8221;
said Grafton. His head was in
a whirl. Beneath a fairly composed exterior
mad impulses to strangle, to kill,
to fight his way to her and bear her off
were raging.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I regret it. And when do you
leave us? That devil, von Moltzahn, is a
dangerous fellow. I&#8217;m having my police
guard you. No; don&#8217;t thank me. It&#8217;s
no trouble, I assure you. You had a
pleasant little talk on law with Fogel this
morning; he was most enthusiastic over
your eagerness to learn; he was talking
with one of my secret police about it. I&#8217;m
sorry you have decided to leave us so soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>&mdash;to-night,
I think you were saying yesterday?
And if you change your mind
about the Rembrandts, you know I&#8217;m always
willing to listen to any reasonable
terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke bowed him out, but did
not offer to shake hands. Grafton entered
his carriage and was driven rapidly away,
an officer in a plain uniform following
him. As soon as Grafton saw it, he drew
the silver box from his pocket, took out
the note, read it until he had it by heart,
then put it in his mouth and swallowed
it. He waited until the road wound close
to the edge of the lake. He looked back;
the officer could not see him. He tossed
the little box into the lake.</p>

<p>At the park gates the carriage was
halted. The officer came up, several others
appeared from the lodge, including one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
who seemed to be of high rank. They
were most polite, most apologetic, but they
took him into the lodge and searched him
thoroughly. And when he went on to
town it was in another carriage.</p>

<p>The proprietor was waiting for him.
&#8220;I regret exceedingly, sir,&#8221; he said, in a
frightened, deprecating voice, &#8220;but your
rooms are taken from ten o&#8217;clock to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be satisfactory to me,&#8221; replied
Grafton. &#8220;I shall leave to-night or
early in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Highness.&#8221; The proprietor
bowed low and beamed gratitude and
relief.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">GRAFTON went into the public
square, opposite the hotel,
and walked up and down under
the trees. Schemes plausible
and schemes fantastical crowded his
brain; the wildest was as practicable as
the most sensible. He cursed his lack of
ingenuity. He felt that the intensity of
his love for Erica was paralyzing thought.
&#8220;In matters about which I care nothing,&#8221;
he said to himself, &#8220;I can always think
of something to do.&#8221; And now he could
think of no plan which he did not almost
instantly dismiss. He could not even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
devise a scheme for seeing Ernestine. To
go to her would be fatal, as the secret police
would go with him, were no doubt watching
her.</p>

<p>He seated himself on a bench at the
other end of which was an American tourist.
There was a certain sense of companionship,
of strength, in the nearness of
a man from &#8220;home&#8221; at such a time. He
noted that his fellow-countryman was a
youth of the unmistakable American type&mdash;tall,
thin, with a narrow, shrewd, frank
face. The longer he looked at him the
better he liked him. After perhaps twenty
minutes the young American rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please sit again without looking at me
or seeming to notice me,&#8221; said Grafton,
not moving his lips.</p>

<p>The young American involuntarily
glanced at him, but looked away instantly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
He seated himself, yawned, took out his
cigarette-case, lighted a cigarette, and began
smoking languidly. A newsboy passed;
Grafton stopped him and bought a
paper. He rested his elbows on his knees,
and so held the paper that his face could
not be seen, yet was apparently not designedly
hid.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Frederick Grafton, and
I&#8217;m from Chicago,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve fallen
in love with a girl here, and&mdash;well, there&#8217;s
the devil to pay. I&#8217;m being watched;
her family&#8217;s got a lot of influence. It is
vital that I see her maid. She lives at
No. 643 Emperor Ferdinand Second Street,
over the bake-shop. Her name is Ernestine
Wundsch. Describe me to her and
tell her to come and sit on the end of this
bench, or, better, send some one she can
trust absolutely. Probably she&#8217;s watched,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
so be careful not to go directly there from
here. Will you help me? On my honor
there is nothing in this affair which, if
you knew it, would make you hesitate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton straightened up and could see
from the corner of his eye that his
countryman was studying his face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll risk
it,&#8221; said the youth, rising and lounging
away.</p>

<p>Soon Grafton began to watch the faces
of passing women. After nearly an hour
a working-man came and sat on the other
end of the bench. Grafton scowled at
him, but he sat placidly smoking his pipe.
At last he said: &#8220;Ernestine, my sister,
did not dare come. She sent me by
the back way. She says nothing can
be done. I waited to be sure it was you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Grafton saw Moltzahn
coming towards him. &#8220;Wait,&#8221; he said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Ernestine&#8217;s brother. &#8220;Don&#8217;t move until
I&#8217;ve spoken to you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moltzahn advanced towards him and
bowed politely, much to Grafton&#8217;s surprise.
&#8220;I know that you are watched,&#8221; he said
to Grafton. &#8220;As I have something to
communicate to you, we must seem to meet
as friendly acquaintances and to be
talking on indifferent subjects. Will you walk
with me a few minutes, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a thinly veiled contempt
in Moltzahn&#8217;s tone which made Grafton
feel like kicking him. But in the
circumstances he would have been civil to
Aloyse himself in the hope of laying hold
of something that would bring him nearer
Erica. He rose, and they began a slow
promenade.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Royal Highness, the Inheriting
Grand Duke, has made me the reluctant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
bearer of a challenge to you. I have tried
to dissuade him, but he is determined to
punish you for your insults. He waives the
difference in rank, the fact that he has no
right to send a challenge to such as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a great pleasure,&#8221; said Grafton,
with grim joy. &#8220;I, too, will waive the
difference of rank&mdash;the fact that he is
not a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible for me to answer you
as you deserve&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t say anything that would
disturb the friendly feeling I have for
you,&#8221; said Grafton. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know
how grateful I am to you for bringing
me this&mdash;this opportunity. I could almost&mdash;yes,
I think I could&mdash;shake hands
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What weapons?&#8221; said Moltzahn. &#8220;But
have you a second?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>&#8220;I shall have one&mdash;and I choose pistols.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suggest that the meeting be at a
little town on the Swiss border&mdash;Zoltenau.
Do you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I shall be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The circumstances make it impossible
to follow the formalities and arrange
through your second. When can you
be there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then at three to-morrow morning.
We shall be on the main road about a
hundred yards from the last house&mdash;the
inn&mdash;at the eastern end of the village.
But will you be able to evade the police?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easily; I shall be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>They bowed, Moltzahn went his way,
Grafton returned to the bench. With his
face concealed, he said to the working-man:
&#8220;In case I should wish to send<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
a message to Ernestine for her mistress,
is there an address that would be safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Johann Windmuller, 41 Duke
Albrecht Street,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. And if there should be
any news for me, send a letter or telegram
to Victor Brandt, care the American Consul,
Schaffhausen. Can you remember that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the man, and he repeated
it twice.</p>

<p>Grafton sent him away; he felt that
the police could not have suspected. He
went to the hotel and in the
smoking-room, near the entrance, found the
American youth. Grafton dropped into a seat
beside him. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;May I ask who has done me this great
service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Burroughs; I come from
San Francisco.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>They discovered that they had many
acquaintances and a few friends in
common, and both belonged to the same club
in New York. Burroughs, who was seven
or eight years younger than Grafton, and
just out of college, had often heard of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything else I can do for
you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Grafton. &#8220;Since I saw
you I&#8217;ve engaged to fight a duel at three
to-morrow morning, and I need a second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be pleased if you&#8217;d accept me, though
I&#8217;ve had no experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I warn you that it may be an ugly
business before it&#8217;s ended, though I think
I can arrange to get you out of it. I mean
to kill my man and his death&#8217;ll make a
row in this part of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you through,&#8221; said Burroughs.</p>

<p>Grafton took him to his rooms, and, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
tested him thoroughly, gave him his
entire confidence. When he had finished
the story, Burroughs said: &#8220;I feel that
you&#8217;re going to win out.&#8221; His eyes were
sparkling with excitement. &#8220;But don&#8217;t
kill him; remember, he&#8217;s her cousin. She
might balk at marrying you if you&#8217;d killed
her cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton thought for a few minutes.
&#8220;That gives me an idea&mdash;that remark of
yours. We&#8217;ll talk it over to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Zoltenau was about midway between
the town of Zweitenbourg and B&acirc;le&mdash;a
score of miles from each&mdash;they decided to
evade the Grand Duke&#8217;s spies by going to
B&acirc;le. Burroughs went on the seven-o&#8217;clock
train to arrange for a doctor and a
carriage. Grafton, leaving on the nine-o&#8217;clock
express, bought places in the bed-car for
Venice. At B&acirc;le he dropped from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
car as the train was passing out at the end
of the station. His servant went on with
the baggage, to return by a roundabout
route to Schaffhausen and there await the
arrival of Victor Brandt.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dropcapA.jpg" width="100" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AS the road from Zweitenbourg
to Zoltenau is almost level,
except the last four miles,
Aloyse, Moltzahn, and Dr.
Kirschner did not set out until nearly one
o&#8217;clock. Aloyse and Moltzahn had
deceived the doctor; he thought he was
going to a friend of theirs who had been
desperately wounded in a duel. Aloyse
was thus unable to boast of what he was
about to do to the &#8220;American pig-dog.&#8221;
As he could think of nothing else, the drive
passed in silence, broken only by feeble
attempts on the part of the doctor to improve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
his good fortune of being in such
distinguished company. They reached the
inn at a quarter before the hour. As they
walked up the road the doctor was
undeceived by Moltzahn.</p>

<p>He stopped and fell to weeping and
wringing his hands with fright. &#8220;A duel&mdash;my
Crown Prince a principal&mdash;my God,
Highness, I shall be ruined! I refuse to
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moltzahn caught him by the arm. &#8220;Come
on, imbecile!&#8221; he said, roughly. &#8220;There
is no turning back now. You will be
protected. But if anything should happen,
think of my fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloyse was a few yards in advance.
He was strutting along with his chest
out. He was confident that the
&#8220;American upstart&#8221; would give him little trouble.
&#8220;A physical bully,&#8221; he said to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
&#8220;Only a gentleman can be brave in a duel.&#8221;
He turned. &#8220;How does the doctor take
it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Crown Prince!&#8221; exclaimed the
doctor. &#8220;I beg you&mdash;I implore you&mdash;&#8221; He
fell on his knees before Aloyse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up! Get up!&#8221; Aloyse spoke in
a kindly, condescending tone. It always
delighted him to receive ocular proof of
his superiority; some of his father&#8217;s remarks
were most disquieting. &#8220;No harm
shall come to you, my good man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor, still weeping and in such
mental turmoil that he forgot to dust the
knees of his trousers and the tails of his
long, black coat, kept pace with Moltzahn.
Aloyse was whistling and brandishing
a small cane. His round face, empty of
all save appetites, was gay&mdash;it became a
prince thus to go to the duel. And, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
fact, he was not a coward, except before
his father; and he longed to punish the
low creature who had dared to lift his eyes
to a princess of the house of Traubenheim,
had dared to lay hands in anger upon a
royal person.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly wait to get at the dog,
Moltzahn,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he won&#8217;t
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moltzahn replied, &#8220;Yes, Your Royal
Highness,&#8221; absently. The nearer he got
to the field the gloomier he became. He
had taken many risks, had done many
degrading things in furthering the
ambition of his life, to be the man next the
throne in Zweitenbourg. But this risk
was a senseless fly straight into the face
of fate.</p>

<p>It was almost broad day when Grafton,
Burroughs, and a doctor from B&acirc;le arrived.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
They lifted their hats to the first-comers.
Dr. Kirschner lifted his hat in return; Moltzahn
gave a slight salute to Burroughs.
Aloyse stared insolently at Grafton and
made no salutation whatever.</p>

<p>Grafton turned to Burroughs. &#8220;You
see, Burroughs, what kind of cattle they
are. I apologize again for bringing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burroughs was white and nervous.
&#8220;Which one do I deal with?&#8221; he asked, in
an undertone.</p>

<p>Grafton pointed at Moltzahn. &#8220;And
keep your eyes on him. He&#8217;s a
blackguard through and through, capable of
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloyse continued to stare at Grafton, a
cruel smile on his lips, and the vindictive
hate of the brainless in his eyes. Grafton
did not like that smile. &#8220;I am taking
long chances,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;but&mdash;I must!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
He turned his face towards the north,
towards Zweitenbourg, and forgot Aloyse.</p>

<p>Moltzahn and Burroughs found a level
well back from the road and private. To
this the party went. The snow on the
peaks was rosy red, and the birds were
awakening to full song, and from the
earth rose the fresh, living gladness of welcome
to the new day. The lot decided that
Aloyse should face the south and Grafton
the north&mdash;&#8220;a good omen,&#8221; thought
Grafton, and the look in his face showed how
far murder was from his heart.</p>

<p>As they were about to take their places
he said to Aloyse, &#8220;I wish a few words
with you in private.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd&mdash;impossible!&#8221; interrupted Moltzahn.
&#8220;Such conduct is intolerable!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton looked at Aloyse as if Moltzahn
had not spoken.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>Aloyse hesitated. &#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; pleaded
Moltzahn, in a whisper. &#8220;He may say
something that will unsettle your nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloyse drew himself up haughtily.
&#8220;Stand aside,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;all of you.
The fellow may wish to apologize. If
so, I may let him off with a sound caning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grafton went close to him. &#8220;It may
be,&#8221; he said, in an even voice, &#8220;that you
will kill me, so I take the precaution of
speaking beforehand. I could easily kill
you, because I happen to be a dead shot
with the pistol. But I shall spare your
life. I shall only shatter your right hand.
I do it that you may wear, as long as
your body holds together, the badge of my
mercy to you&mdash;for her sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you speak of her!&#8221; fumed
Aloyse. &#8220;Yes; I shall kill you for your
insolence to our house.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>&#8220;It amuses me to see you rage,&#8221; said
Grafton. &#8220;It makes me realize what I
rescued her from.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloyse was in a paroxysm of anger.
&#8220;My cousin and I will marry the day
after to-morrow. It is all arranged&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All&mdash;except her consent,&#8221; answered
Grafton, with a mocking smile. &#8220;I love
her. I know her. I trust her. However
this may fall out, she will never marry
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned to his place. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve
put a shake into his hand,&#8221; he said to
Burroughs, in an undertone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mind admitting I tried to, as this is a farce
so far as I am concerned. I&#8217;m not anxious
to die if I can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moltzahn, holding the pistols, was
standing midway between Aloyse and Grafton,
and a little to one side. He looked from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Grafton to Aloyse. &#8220;Walk towards me,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and when you are face to face
turn your backs each to the other. I
will hand each of you a pistol. Walk
towards your places again, and when you
reach them stand without turning until
Mr. Burroughs begins to count. At three
turn and fire at your convenience. Are
you ready, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloyse and Grafton bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Advance!&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked slowly and steadily, each
towards the other. Grafton seemed dreamy
and abstracted, Aloyse&#8217;s little brown eyes
were angry and his brows were drawn in
an exaggerated frown. When they were
about two feet apart, Moltzahn, standing
as near to one as to the other, said:
&#8220;Turn!&#8221;</p>

<p>They wheeled, and he handed each a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
cocked pistol. &#8220;To your places, gentlemen,&#8221;
he said. They began the slow return.
Burroughs, his hands trembling, was
trying to moisten his lips for the giving
of the signal. The two doctors, all in
black and with long brown beards, stood
apart, the Swiss doctor interested but
calm, the Zweitenbourgian with his knees
knocking together and his hands sliding
nervously one over the other. The sun,
clearing the crest of a ridge, sent an enormous
billow of light to burst through the
mists and flood the dense, dew-showered
foliage of the western front of the valley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Burroughs,&#8221; said Moltzahn,
in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;One!&#8221; said Burroughs, and his voice
was thin and shrill; the sound of it made
him shiver. &#8220;Oh, God!&#8221; he thought, &#8220;I
may be giving the signal for a murder.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>&#8220;Two!&#8221; His voice was hoarse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three!&#8221; wrenched itself from his tightening
throat in a gasp. He hid his face
in his arms. &#8220;What have I done? What
have I done?&#8221; he groaned. It seemed an
eternity; why did they not shoot and
have it over with? He dropped his arm
and looked; they had had barely time
to come round face to face.</p>

<p>Aloyse fired first by an instant; then
Grafton. Grafton stood motionless. Aloyse
gave an exclamation of pain; his pistol
dropped to the ground and the blood spurted
over his shattered hand until it was red
and raining red from every finger.</p>

<p>Grafton, his feet together, began slowly
to fall forward, his eyes closing. Burroughs
cried out and rushed to him and
caught him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; he whispered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>&#8220;A mere trifle&mdash;a scratch on the arm,&#8221;
whispered Grafton. &#8220;Sh! Be careful!&#8221;
And he closed his eyes and lay motionless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, Dr. Berners!&#8221; exclaimed Burroughs,
starting up wildly from beside his
friend. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s been killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berners was already there, was tearing
open Grafton&#8217;s coat, waistcoat, shirt, and
undershirt. Dr. Kirschner, his face beaming
and his hands rubbing, bustled up.
&#8220;His Royal Highness has been graciously
pleased to send me to render what aid
I can. His Royal Highness&#8217;s own wound
is slight&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to your master!&#8221; exclaimed Burroughs,
apparently beside himself with rage
and grief, and standing between Kirschner
and Grafton. &#8220;My friend is dead&mdash;shot
down by that assassin!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>Dr. Kirschner put on the death-bed
look. &#8220;Let us hope not so bad as
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;dead,&#8221; said Berners, looking
round at his colleague and shielding Grafton
so that Kirschner could not see his
chest. &#8220;He is shot through the heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kirschner rushed to Aloyse and Moltzahn.
Aloyse was ruefully regarding the
bandage Kirschner had hastily wrapped
round his hand before going on Aloyse&#8217;s
magnanimous mission. &#8220;I regret to inform
Your Royal Highness that Mr. Grafton&#8217;s
wound is most serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; Aloyse scowled. &#8220;I aimed
for his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Kirschner lowered his eyes; even
his humble soul revolted. &#8220;Your Royal
Highness,&#8221; he said, in a low voice, &#8220;Mr.
Grafton is dead.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; Aloyse&#8217;s lips shrivelled and
he staggered slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Royal Highness shot him through
the heart,&#8221; said Moltzahn, in a congratulatory
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; Aloyse&#8217;s voice was hoarse.
&#8220;Let us go,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must dress Your Royal Highness&#8217;s
wound,&#8221; urged Kirschner.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the carriage,&#8221; Aloyse answered,
impatiently. He cast a hasty glance towards
the group on the grass&mdash;the prostrate
man, the two kneeling beside him. &#8220;Let
us go,&#8221; he said, and led the way.</p>

<small>The Grand Duke Prepares to
Celebrate</small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the drive back to Zweitenbourg
Aloyse&#8217;s spirits gradually
rose. He ceased to see
that group with such painful
distinctness; Moltzahn and presently
Dr. Kirschner flattered him on his marksmanship.
Pshaw! it had been a mere coincidence
that Grafton had shot him precisely
as he said he would. He forced himself to
remember more and more vividly Grafton&#8217;s
impudence&mdash;and impudence to a Traubenheim!
And impudence to a Traubenheim
in an affair of the heart!&mdash;and that affair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
one in which the lady was also a Traubenheim.
He had but meted out just punishment
for an assault upon his own honor,
the honor of his wife-to-be, the honor of his
house.</p>

<p>In the last two or three miles he was
hilarious, boasting boisterously&mdash;he had
had something to drink and nothing to
eat&mdash;of his prowess and of how all Traubenheims
always thus served the impudent
enemies of their house. And Moltzahn,
concealing his contempt and disgust,
and Dr. Kirschner, full of the loyalty of a
devoted subject, urged him on. He set the
doctor down at his house and Moltzahn at
his club&mdash;Moltzahn did not dare show himself
at The Castle. Then he drove on with
a growing appetite. He reached The Castle
at seven o&#8217;clock, just in time for his
regular breakfast with his father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>The Grand Duke was invariably in a
vile humor in the morning; he ate so much
and exercised so little that he slept badly.
He insisted on his son always breakfasting
alone with him, and, under the pretence of
training him for the throne, wreaked his
ill-humor upon him. Aloyse hurriedly
changed from the plain clothes in which
he had fought to an undress uniform, and
flew to the breakfast-room. He was in
high spirits; at last he had done
something which his father would applaud. As
he entered, Casimir looked at him sourly.
He brought his heels together and saluted.
Then he advanced, as usual, bent his
knee, but put his left hand, instead of his
right, under his father&#8217;s right hand extended
for him to kiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with your right
hand?&#8221; screamed the Grand Duke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>Aloyse jumped and shivered like a guilty
child and his wits scattered. He held out
his right hand in its sling, stupidly staring
at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak&mdash;and no lies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a duel,&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke pushed back his chair
from the table. His look was so frightful
that terror gave speed to Aloyse&#8217;s tongue.
&#8220;I challenged the American, father&mdash;and
killed him,&#8221; he said, the last phrase explosively.
&#8220;I shot him through the
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Casimir brought his chair close to the
table again, lifted his cup of coffee, and
drew in several draughts, each with a
loud, sucking sound. &#8220;Eat your breakfast!&#8221;
he said, in a sharp but not unkindly
tone. &#8220;You must be hungry; have one
of my peaches.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>Casimir&#8217;s peaches were his especial dish.
They were grown at great expense under
his own eye, and no one else was permitted
to have them. In all his life Aloyse could
remember only one occasion on which his
father had offered to share his peaches;
it was twenty years before, when Aloyse,
seated in a high-chair at that table, had
seen the Prime Minister take one at Casimir&#8217;s
request; the reason, as Aloyse learned
long afterwards, was that the Prime Minister
had saved the Traubenheims their title
of &#8220;Royal Highness,&#8221; which was gravely
threatened. Though he detested peaches,
Aloyse ate the peach greedily, swelling
with pride and importance.</p>

<p>Prudence bade him say no more of his
achievement; but vanity and a loose tongue
impelled him to seek further flatteries from
his father. He looked at the old man&#8217;s sardonic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
yellow face several times before he
ventured to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask to be permitted to tell Erica
myself,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>His father stopped eating and raised
his head from his plate. He seemed to
have concentrated all the acidity of his
nature in his face. The color rose in
Aloyse&#8217;s cheeks and mounted his brow
until his features were all ablaze and a
sweat was standing on his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;You propose to tell the woman you
wish to marry, and whose consent you
must get&mdash;you propose to tell her that you
have murdered her lover.&#8221; Casimir said
the words slowly, without accent, quietly.
Then he put his face down until it was
again hovering within a few inches of his
plate.</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and Casimir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
spoke again. &#8220;Every day you remind
me more and more of your grand-uncle.&#8221;
Aloyse remembered his grand-uncle&mdash;the
Grand Duke Wilhelm, a jibbering idiot,
who sat all day on the floor in a corner
gnawing his nails and his great whiskers.</p>

<p>Another long pause, and Casimir spoke
again. &#8220;Go to your apartments, and don&#8217;t
leave them until I summon you. And
never permit a syllable about your duel
to escape your lips. Deny it; if necessary,
<i>swear</i> you know nothing about it. If
possible, she must never know how he
died or that he&#8217;s dead. Be off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Later in the morning Casimir read the
report of the chief of his secret police on
Grafton&#8217;s last hours in Zweitenbourg.
His secret agents said that Grafton had
communicated with no one except an
American tourist&mdash;an obviously casual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
acquaintance and talk; that Ernestine
had not moved from her home over the
bake-shop in Emperor Ferdinand Second
Street. And when the chief came to him
and in great confusion confessed that
his men had lost Grafton between Zweitenbourg
and Venice, the Grand Duke was
sarcastic but not angry. &#8220;Drop the matter,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>He sent Baron Zeppstein to inquire how
Her Serene Highness did, and whether
she would permit His Royal Highness to
do himself the honor of waiting upon her.
As the answer was favorable, Casimir put
on his most paternal face and went to
Erica&#8217;s apartments. She was all fire and
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;First,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I demand that Your
Royal Highness send away that woman
and that soldier.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>&#8220;Certainly, my child.&#8221; And he went to
the door and himself ordered them away.
As the woman was leaving he called her
back. He returned to Erica. &#8220;Shall I
send for your own maid?&#8221; he said. &#8220;This
woman can fetch her. Yes?&#8221; And he
told the woman to bring Ernestine
forthwith.</p>

<p>&#8220;The peril is past,&#8221; he said, standing
beside Erica and laying his hand on her
shoulder. &#8220;I know what youth and hot
blood are; I, too, have dreamed of happiness.
But our rank means duty; to you it means
Aloyse and the future of our ancient house.
You think I&#8217;m harsh, child, but it is the
kindness of experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erica looked scorn at him. &#8220;The grand-ducal
house of Traubenheim,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;has the throne. The ducal house has
the private wealth. Yes, my dear uncle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
you are, indeed, kind&mdash;to yourself and
Aloyse. You know&mdash;none better&mdash;that
your son is an ignorant, brutish fool.
You know that this life here is dull and
repellent&mdash;a hell on earth, a mockery of a
life, a torture-pen of yawning and meaningless
routine. Don&#8217;t flatter my intelligence,
my dear uncle, by talking of your
kindness and my duty.&#8221; She started up.
&#8220;And sooner or later I shall go where love
and life call me,&#8221; she exclaimed,
passionately.</p>

<p>A ghost of a sardonic smile flitted over
the yellow old face at this reference to
Grafton. Then he said, sternly, but
without harshness: &#8220;We shall send the heralds
into the town this afternoon to
proclaim the marriage for Monday. We shall
announce in the <i>Gazette</i> that the Inheriting
Grand Duke is ill, and that, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
of your great love for him and his for you,
the marriage has been hastened. And on
Monday you will be married.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man spoke with much dignity&mdash;the
dignity of one all his life accustomed
to being implicitly obeyed, of one descended
from a long line of arbitrary rulers. And
although Erica denounced and denied his
command with all the strength of her
soul, his words sounded to her like clods
upon a coffin.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I said,&#8221; he went on, in a gentler
voice, &#8220;the peril is past. That young adventurer,
that young picture dealer from
across the water&#8221;&mdash;he laughed&mdash;&#8220;his impudence
was refreshing! I admire audacity;
he almost deserved to win; I&#8217;m
not surprised that you were almost swept
off your feet. But he will not annoy you
further. He&#8217;s gone, my child; he took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
himself away last night. So, feeling that
you were no longer in danger of being
annoyed and humiliated by his
impertinences, I have removed the guards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am free?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be well,&#8221; said Casimir, with
faint emphasis, &#8220;for you to keep within
The Castle for the present; of course, you
must have your walks under proper
protection.&#8221;</p>

<p>He extended his hand for her to kiss
it. For the first time in her life the act
seemed not a ceremony but a
degradation. &#8220;I begin anew here,&#8221; she said to
herself. She pretended not to see his
hand. He slipped away with his soft,
sliding shuffle. When he walked in that
fashion those who knew him feared him.</p>

<small>An Overwhelming Defeat</small></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dropcapT.jpg" width="100" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was no time to be lost,
as it was now noon, Saturday,
and the wedding was to be on
Monday. As soon as Ernestine
came Erica began to act.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go back home at once,&#8221;
she said to her. &#8220;You have forgotten
your clothes; that will do as a pretext.
Send your brother to Schaffhausen on
the first train. He must see Mr. Brandt
and tell him to meet me to-night at the
first cross-road beyond the park gates.
I shall try to be there at one. If I can
come at all, it will not be later than three.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
If he cannot come, he will find me at the
Hotel Rhein to-morrow, or next day, under
the name of Madam von Briesen.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Ernestine left The Castle a soldier
joined her, saying: &#8220;My orders are to go
with you and let no one speak to you
except in my presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ernestine took this news with a seeming
of great cheerfulness, and jested with her
guard all the way to town. Her family
lived in three rooms, and with a little
diplomacy she easily delivered her message
to her brother in the rear room while
the soldier sat in the front room drinking
beer with her youngest sister. But she
did not venture to call at Windmuller&#8217;s, in
Duke Albrecht Street.</p>

<p>When she returned to The Castle the
preparations for the wedding were going
forward apace. The central part, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
were the principal rooms of state, was open
at every window and door; tradespeople
were coming and going; there were sounds
of hammering, clouds of dust from the
windows, a press of wagons about the
doors. The Grand Duke had decided to
make the wedding a big, public affair, so
that Erica would feel that it was impossible
to retreat. And he had left it open
whether the ceremony itself was to be public
or private.</p>

<p>At eleven that night Ernestine crept
softly down the corridor and reconnoitred
both stairways leading from the apartments
of Her Serene Highness to the lower
floors. At the foot of each was a soldier
with a huge white rosette on his left arm,
in honor of the coming gayeties. Erica
had expected this; she simply wished to
discover where the enemy lay. She dressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
in the uniform of a lieutenant of the Household
Guards. When she and Ernestine
had made it, two years before, she had been
full of the idea of running away for several
days to &#8220;see the world&#8221; from a man&#8217;s
point of view. But her audacity failed
her&mdash;that is, she permitted the obstacles to
seem insurmountable, and she never got
beyond parading her rooms in it, with
Ernestine as a critic of her counterfeit of
a man&#8217;s figure and walk. The feat she
now proposed would have been extremely
difficult, if not impossible, in woman&#8217;s
dress.</p>

<p>She was putting the finishing touches
to her masculine toilet when Ernestine
hurried into her dressing-room in a panic.
Baron Zeppstein was waiting to see her.
Erica drew off her top-boots and thrust
her feet into a pair of slippers; she drew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
on a loose wrapper, tied a white shawl
about her shoulders, and, letting down her
hair, appeared before the Baron.</p>

<p>Zeppstein&#8217;s old head was almost knocking
his swollen knee-joints. &#8220;By His
Royal Highness&#8217;s command, Your Serene
Highness,&#8221; he said, humbly, &#8220;I come to
inquire of you in person whether you are
entirely comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erica was gracious, bade him sit, asked
about the preparations for the wedding in
detail, made several adroit remarks which
seemed to indicate that she was secretly
preparing to yield but did not wish to
gratify the Grand Duke and humiliate
herself by relieving his suspense. Zeppstein
went away convinced, and was able
to make a convincing report which stood
the test of Casimir&#8217;s exhaustive and searching
cross-examination.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>It was now midnight and Ernestine put
out all lights. She was to go to bed,
and if any one came and insisted upon
seeing her mistress, she was to detain him
as long as possible, and profess ignorance
and alarm should the flight be discovered.</p>

<p>Erica advanced down the lofty stone
passage-way. It was an alternation of
bands of darkness and bands of moonlight.
She took the second corridor to the left
and stole along it until, in the darkness,
her foot touched the first step of the ascending
stairway. She went up, opened the
door at the top, and entered. When she
had bolted this door she breathed more
freely.</p>

<p>She went up a second and narrower
flight of stairs and slipped through a window
to a small balcony. It was in the
full moonlight, but it looked only upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
the roofs and the deserted battlements of
The Castle. Holding to the ridge of stone
above her head she stepped to the next
balcony. From this she was able to go
out upon the ledge extending along the
huge tower fifteen or twenty feet above
the battlements. The ledge was narrow
and there was no hold for her hands. She
clung to the wall and sidled slowly along,
feeling her way with her feet and her body.
She did not dare open her eyes except
when she paused.</p>

<p>At last she came to the place where the
ledge passed immediately above and very
close to the pointed roof of the throne-room.
She stepped down softly and cautiously;
the roof was steep, and, should she slip, she
would slide to the edge, where, if she did
not fall to the battlements, she would cling
until rescued and returned to captivity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
She worked herself along the ridge of the
roof to the great circular skylight which
divided it into two parts. She glanced
down through one of the open sections.
Scores of people were at work decorating
the throne-room for the wedding.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I fail,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;I shall be
forced there, perhaps, and it is set for
to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>The last qualm of nervousness left her.
She walked the ledge round the skylight
and crawled out upon the pointed roof
beyond. She drew herself along it until
she was above one of the windows projecting
from the slope of the roof. She
let herself down; she touched the cap of
the window; she slid slowly along the
outer edge of its frame until she was able
to reach round into it.</p>

<p>It was fastened. Clinging to roof and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
window-frame she unbuckled her sword,
and with it broke a pane of glass. She
listened; not a sound after the echo of
the crash had died away. Then she
became conscious that some one else was
on that roof.</p>

<p>With heart beating wildly and body
trembling she peered round the window-frame.
Far away along the ridge of the
roof she saw a shape which was unmistakably
a man&#8217;s. And as she watched,
it moved; it was some one coming from
the eastern end towards her. Had he seen
her, or had he come after she had slid behind
the window-frame? She feared he
was on his way to intercept her, but she
did not lose heart.</p>

<p>She reached through the broken pane
and unfastened the window and opened
it. Then, with as little noise and as little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
exposure of herself as the profound quiet
and the brightness of the moon permitted,
she crawled round the projecting frame
and into the window. She ventured to
glance out and upward again; the man
was creeping along the ridge; he had
passed the point where he would have
begun to descend towards her if he had
seen or heard her; he was moving in the
direction from which she had come. With
a long sigh she closed the window. &#8220;Two
minutes later,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;and
I should have been taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was in an empty room, in the attic
of the extreme eastern end of the central
part of The Castle. She brushed her uniform,
straightened her belt and sword,
set her helmet well forward on her head,
and sallied forth. She went down the
stairway, cobwebs clinging to her face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
and sounds of the movements of disturbed
creatures&mdash;bats or birds&mdash;coming to her
through the darkness. At the foot of a
second and long flight of stairs she found
herself on the landing from which two
great corridors branched&mdash;the one to the
right leading to liberty, the one to the left
leading to her cousin Aloyse&#8217;s apartments.</p>

<p>Some one was coming towards her in
the corridor to the right; she was compelled
to take Aloyse&#8217;s corridor. The footsteps&mdash;they
were cautious footsteps&mdash;followed
her. She shrank into a niche and
stood like a statue. As the man passed
a window the moonlight revealed him to
her&mdash;Prince von Moltzahn. He was disregarding
her uncle&#8217;s prohibition and was
coming to see Aloyse. He opened a door
so nearly opposite where she stood that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
could see into the room&mdash;could see Aloyse,
in a dressing-gown, seated at a table on
which was a tray containing bottles of
whiskey and soda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! von Moltzahn; you were never
so welcome. No; leave the door open.
It&#8217;s frightful in here. I can&#8217;t breathe.
Help yourself to the whiskey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expected to find you ill,&#8221; said Moltzahn.
&#8220;His Royal Highness has given
out that you have a fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and he&#8217;s shut me up here until
the wedding. He treats me like a dog.
But wait until I&#8217;m married and get hold
of some cash. He won&#8217;t be able to keep
his feet on my neck then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why has he shut you in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell Her Serene Highness
that I&#8217;d killed that American pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>Erica heard; but not until the words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
had repeated themselves again and again
in her brain did she understand them.
Her cousin went on: &#8220;He was pleased
when I told him; he gave me one of his
peaches. But he doesn&#8217;t want her to
know about it. He doesn&#8217;t understand
women&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; exclaimed Moltzahn,
and both leaped to their feet. Aloyse
rushed to the doorway.</p>

<p>Erica had sunk straight down to the
floor, and, as her collapsed body fell over,
her sword and helmet clashed against
the stone. Aloyse, looking into the dimness,
could see the form of a soldier&mdash;suggestions
of the uniform of the Household
Guards. He muttered a curse.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; called Moltzahn.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old brute has put a guard over
me,&#8221; said Aloyse, turning back, &#8220;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the fellow&#8217;s in a drunken sleep. You&#8217;d
better go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moltzahn fled, with only a glance at
Erica, and Aloyse closed his door and
went sullenly to bed. Gradually the coolness
of the stone revived her. She sat
up&mdash;and remembered. She could not imagine,
did not try to imagine, how long
she had lain there or why she had not
been discovered. A wave of desolation
swept over her. She had thought she
loved this man who had come into her
life so suddenly, who had taken her heart
by storm, who had opened for her a way
of escape from a wearisome life which
marriage to her cousin would have made
hideous, unendurable. But she did not
until now realize how much she loved him&mdash;not
as her liberator but as her lover.
&#8220;No; he is not dead!&#8221; her heart protested.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
&#8220;Aloyse is a liar, a braggart. There
is some mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dragged herself to her feet. &#8220;I will
go back,&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;Dead&mdash;my love
is dead!&#8221; She knew that it was the
truth; she felt that it was a lie. &#8220;But I
shall go back&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>To what? To be the wife of the man
she had heard boasting of his murder.
She became suddenly strong. &#8220;Never!
Never!&#8221; And aching with grief, yet hoping
beside the corpse of hope, she rushed on
until she was almost in the arms of a
sentinel. She turned back and dropped
upon a bench round a corner a few feet
from him. The big bell of the chapel
boomed half-past one. She rose and went
a few steps in the direction of Aloyse&#8217;s
room. Hate, a passion for vengeance,
was bounding through her veins; she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
would wrench the truth from him, then
kill him.</p>

<p>But now there came the sound of several
shots and confused shouts. The sentinel
ran, and she turned and followed
him across one of the huge entrance halls
out into the open; the cool air from the
mountains poured upon her, and her heart
began to revive. She saw a man dart
from the shadow of The Castle&#8217;s walls
to the west, strike down a soldier who
barred his path, and run zig-zag towards
the forest. All were rushing in that direction,
and she ran also, but as quickly as
she could plunged into the deep shadows.
She made a d&eacute;tour and took a course
parallel to the road that led to the park
gates, two miles and a half away. She
must get to the cross-roads where Ernestine&#8217;s
brother would be waiting&mdash;to tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
her that her lover was dead! But instead
of enfeebling her the thought carried only
enough conviction of its truth to inflame
her desire to get away&mdash;to fly where she
would never again see the wretch who had
desolated her.</p>

<p>There was some one in the shadow ahead;
it must be the escaping robber. But how
would he&mdash;how would she&mdash;pass the sentinel
at the park gates? The alarm must
have been signalled from The Castle. She
was almost exhausted. She could see
the robber&mdash;he was between her and the
one dim gate-lamp over the small side
gate. He heard her coming and whirled
about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; she panted, hoarsely; were
they not companions in flight? &#8220;I&#8217;ll get
you through!&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed her as she ran straight for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
the sentry, who was standing with his gun
at a challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; said the sentry, loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! Quick! Open!&#8221; she panted.
The robber, who had been standing aloof,
suspicious of her now that he saw her
uniform, came forward. The sentry also
noted the uniform and saluted. &#8220;There&#8217;s
been a robbery or something at The Castle&mdash;&#8221;
he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;That&#8217;s it&mdash;open&mdash;don&#8217;t
delay us!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentry stupidly stood aside, and she
and the robber dashed through the side
gate and down the dark road abreast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi! Come back!&#8221; yelled the sentry,
his slow wits at last collecting in a doubt.
He sent a shot after them.</p>

<p>But they ran the faster, getting into
the deepest shadow. At the second bend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
from the gates she stopped and sank into
the grass. The robber stopped also.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; she gasped, in a whisper; her
voice was all but gone. &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be fair,&#8221; he said. At
the sound of his voice she rose up, flung
her arms about his neck, and fainted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; ejaculated the man. &#8220;What&#8217;ll
I do with him?&#8221; He held her in his arms,
looking helplessly about. He tried to lift
her to his shoulders, but he was too exhausted
to bear the additional weight. He
laid her in the grass and ran on down the
road.</p>

<p>She came to in the dampness and cold
of the long grass. As she sat up a troop
of cavalry rushed by on its way to the
town. She began to remember; she had
got the robber through the gates, and
then delirium had seized her and she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
fancied he was Grafton&mdash;no, it was not
delirium; he <i>was</i> Grafton! She understood
now; her message had not reached
him, but he had come on his own plan; it
was he who passed her on the roof of the
throne-room; it was he who, seeking her,
had been discovered, and, making a dash
for liberty, had given her the chance
to escape&mdash;no, it was not delirium. But
where was he now? She could hear only
the murmur of the woods. Why had he
left her after she had flung her arms about
his neck?</p>

<p>From far down the road in the direction
of the town came a rush and roar as of a
locomotive. She rose to her knees, to her
feet. It was a racing-automobile. As it
drew near its pace slackened and its noise
grew louder. It came to a stop a few feet
from her and stood shaking and panting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>&#8220;Somewhere along here,&#8221; she heard,
in Grafton&#8217;s voice, and he leaped from the
seat and came into the shadow. &#8220;Oh,
there you are! Why didn&#8217;t you call out?
Come, get in here!&#8221; And he caught her
by the arm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear the cavalry
coming back?&#8221; He half lifted, half flung
her into the seat and leaped in himself.
&#8220;Turn about, Burroughs, and go straight
for &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to speak, but she was dumb,
limp. The automobile sprang forward and
was soon going at a tremendous pace; it
would have been impossible for a voice
to be heard. She looked ahead; the wind
was shrieking in her ears; the cavalrymen
had halted in a moonlit stretch of
the road.</p>

<p>She could see their pistols lifting. &#8220;They
are about to fire!&#8221; she thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>She flung off her helmet, released her
hair, and stood up. The moon was shining
full upon her face and upon her long
hair streaming and gleaming behind her.
She saw the pistols instantly fall before
the apparition of &#8220;Her Serene Highness,&#8221;
and the horses reined back upon their
haunches. The automobile rushed past
them at the speed of an express train and
fled, unpursued and unpursuable, along
the military road towards the Swiss border.</p>

<p>She felt somebody&#8217;s arms close about
her and then somebody&#8217;s kisses on her
face.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT dinner at the H&ocirc;tel Krone,
Schaffhausen, that same evening,
Grafton told his wife and
Burroughs the story of the
Spaniard&mdash;how it had led him to her.
She secretly resolved that the Spaniard
must and should be theirs. In the morning
she wrote her uncle an offer to give
up the part of her estates that lay
in the Grand Duchy in exchange for the
picture. The acceptance came, prompt
and polite; Casimir is not the man to
bite his nails and chatter his teeth at fate.
And so there was a surprise for Grafton
when they went to Paris.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>And this is the true story of how it
happens that the spurious Velasquez again
hangs in the Grafton house in Michigan
Avenue. But it is not in its old place in
the galleries. It is on the wall beyond the
foot of Mrs. Grafton&#8217;s bed.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
